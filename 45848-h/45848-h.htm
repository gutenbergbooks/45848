<h2 class="main">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following pages contain the record of a journey
made to islands and lands that border the Caribbean and to the less
frequented parts of Venezuela and Colombia. Thanks to our trade
relations with the Antilles, and the number of meritorious books that
have been written about them during the last few decades, our knowledge
of the West Indies is fairly complete and satisfactory. The same,
however, cannot be said of the two extensive republics just south of
us. Outside of their capitals and a few of their coast towns, they are
rarely visited, and as a consequence, the most erroneous ideas prevail
regarding them. Vast regions in both republics are now less known than
they were three centuries ago, while there are certain sections about
which our knowledge is as limited as it is regarding the least explored
portions of darkest Africa.</p>
<p>This is not the place to account for the prevailing ignorance
regarding the parts of the New Hemisphere that first claimed the
attention of discoverers and explorers. Suffice it to state that,
paradoxical as it may seem, it is, nevertheless, a fact.</p>
<p>When we recollect that the lands in question were not only the first
discovered but that they were also witnesses of the marvelous
achievements of some of the most renowned of the conquistadores, our
surprise becomes doubly great that our information respecting them is
so meager and confined almost exclusively to those who make a special
study of things South American.</p>
<p>Never, perhaps, in the history of our race was the spirit of
adventure so generally diffused as it was at the dawn of the sixteenth
century&mdash;just after the epoch-making discoveries of Columbus and
his hardy followers. It was like the spirit that animated the Crusaders
when they started on their long march to recover the Holy Sepulchre
from the possession of the Moslem. It was, indeed, in many of its
aspects, a revival of the age of chivalry. The Sea of Darkness had at
last been successfully crossed. That ocean of legend and mystery with
its enchanted islands inhabited by witches and gnomes and griffins had
been explored. And that strange <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e230"
href="#xd21e230" name="xd21e230">x</a>]</span>island of Satanaxio,
&ldquo;the island of the hand of Satan,&rdquo; where the Evil One was
&ldquo;supposed once a day to thrust forth a gigantic hand from the
ocean to grasp a number of the inhabitants&rdquo; was consigned to the
limbo of medi&aelig;val superstitions. A new world was revealed to the
astonished Spaniards. Every animal, tree, plant seemed new to them and
often entirely different from anything the Old World could show. There
was, too, a new race of men, with strange manners and customs&mdash;men
who told them of a Fountain of Youth, of regions of pearls and precious
stones, of cities and palaces of gold in the lofty plateau and in the
heart of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Those who first came to the New World acted as if they were in a
land of enchantment and were prepared to believe any tale, however
preposterous, that appealed to their lust of gold or love of adventure.
No enterprise was too difficult for them, no hardship too great.
Neither trackless forests, nor miasmatic climates, nor ruthless savages
could deter them from their quest of treasure, or quench their thirst
for glory and emolument. Hence those extraordinary expeditions in
search of El Dorado,&mdash;that El Dorado which Quesada hoped to find
in Cundinamarca, his brother in Casanare, Orsua among the Omaguas on
the Amazon, Philipp von Hutten in the regions of the Meta and the
Guaviare, and Cesar and Belalcazar in the territories drained by the
Cauca and the Magdalena,&mdash;in which were combined the extravagant
performances of a Don Quixote with the feats of prowess of a Rodrigo
Diaz. The spirit of knight-errantry seemed to revive and to bring with
it an age of romance that for hardihood of enterprise and variety of
incident surpassed any period that had preceded it. The feats of
individual prowess were as brilliant as the success of Spanish arms was
pronounced and far-reaching. It was an age of epics, of poetry in
action.</p>
<p>Lord Macaulay, in his essay on Lord Clive, writes, &ldquo;We have
always thought it strange that, while the history of the Spanish empire
in America is familiarly known to all the nations of Europe, the great
actions of our countrymen in the East should, even among ourselves,
excite little interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One reason for the difference noted was the absence, in the English
conquest of India, of those romantic and picturesque elements that so
distinguished the achievements of the conquistadores in the New World,
and which so fascinated Leo X, that he sat up all night <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e238" href="#xd21e238" name=
"xd21e238">xi</a>]</span>to read the <i>Decades</i> of Peter Martyr.
&ldquo;The picturesque descriptions,&rdquo; declares Theodore Irving,
in his <i>Conquest of Florida</i>, &ldquo;of steel-clad cavaliers with
lance and helmet and prancing steed, glittering through the
wildernesses of Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the prairies of the Far
West, would seem to us fictions of romance, did they not come to us
recorded in matter-of-fact narratives of contemporaries, and
corroborated by minute and daily memoranda of eye-witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same can be said with even more truth of the conquistadores of
the Spanish Main and of the daring adventurers who first penetrated the
trackless forests and scaled the lofty mountains of Venezuela and New
Granada. &ldquo;Their minds,&rdquo; as Fiske well observes, &ldquo;were
in a state like that of the heroes of the Arabian Nights who, if they
only wander far enough through the dark forest or across the burning
desert, are sure at length to come upon some enchanted palace whereof
they may fairly hope, with the aid of some gracious Jinni, to become
masters.&rdquo; Thus it was that Cortes, unaided, however, by a
gracious Jinni, became the master of the capital of the Aztecs, as
Quesada and Pizarro became the masters of the lands and the treasures
of the Muiscas and the Incas.</p>
<p>It is impossible for the student of early American history to cruise
along the Spanish Main, or sail on the broad waters of the Orinoco, the
Meta and the Magdalena, without harking back at every turn to the
achievements of some of the early discoverers or conquistadores. Every
island, every promontory, every river has been visited by them and, if
endowed with speech, they could tell thrilling stories of daring
adventure and brilliant exploit unsurpassed in the annals of chivalry
and crusading valor. Every place he goes, he will find that he has been
preceded by the Spaniard by three or four centuries, for everywhere he
will find traces or traditions of his passage.</p>
<p>It matters not that the Spaniards were lured on by such
ever-receding chimeras as Manoa, El Dorado and Lake Parime, that many
other objects of their quest were as mythical as that of the Argonauts
or as unattainable as the golden apples of the Hesperides. Their
expeditions were not for these reasons wholly fruitless. Every one of
them, whether for the purpose of exploration or conquest or
colonization, contributed to our knowledge of the lands visited and of
the tribes inhabiting them, many of whom have long since disappeared.
And everywhere one finds towns founded by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e252" href="#xd21e252" name="xd21e252">xii</a>]</span>them, or
places, mountains and rivers that still bear the names that were given
them at the time of their discovery.</p>
<p>It was always our pleasure, during our wanderings in the tropics, to
recall what the first explorers thought of the new lands visited by
them while they were still under the spell of the novel and marvelous
things that were ever claiming their rapt attention whithersoever they
went. We loved to look upon the countries we visited as their first
explorers had looked upon them. This we were able to do, for thanks to
the old chroniclers, the wonderment of the discovery of the New World
has been preserved, as in amber, in all its freshness, and that, too,
for all time to come.</p>
<p>Comparatively few people realize how extensive is the literature,
especially in Spanish, that relates to the period of the conquest and
that immediately following it. And still fewer are aware of its intense
interest and importance. In addition to the well-known classic works of
Peter Martyr, Las Casas, Herrera, Oviedo, Garcilaso de la Vega, Cieza
de Leon, Gomara, Acosta, and others scarcely less valuable, there are
scores of similar annals that have for centuries lain in the archives
of Spain and of the various countries of Latin-America which have but
recently been published. Many of these&mdash;beyond price for the
historian&mdash;were absolutely unknown until a few years ago, and are
still awaiting the artistic pen of a Prescott or an Irving to transmute
their contents in masterpieces of literature. It is safe to say that
nowhere else will the man of letters find a more fertile and a less
cultivated field to engage his talent.</p>
<p>Then there are the works, equally precious, of the early
missionaries. Many of them are veritable mines of information
respecting the manners and customs of the native inhabitants of the
tropics, while not a few of them are the only sources extant of
knowledge respecting many interesting Indian tribes that have long
since become extinct. Among these deserving of special notice are the
works of Simon, Gilli, Caulin, Rivero, Cassani, Gumilla and
Piedrahita&mdash;not to mention others of lesser note&mdash;that treat
specially of Venezuela and New Granada, and afford us the truest
picture of the condition of these countries during their existence
under Spanish domination. Humboldt frequently quotes them in his
instructive <i>Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions
of America</i>, and usually with the generous approval and commendation
which they so well deserve. To the humble and intelligent and often
erudite missionaries of the tropics the illustrious German <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e264" href="#xd21e264" name=
"xd21e264">xiii</a>]</span>savant was indebted for much of the success
that attended his explorations in the basin of the Orinoco and along
the plateau of the Cordilleras.</p>
<p>Worthy of mention, too, in traversing countries where the traveler
has not the benefit of a Murray or a Baedeker, are the numerous works
of those explorers&mdash;German, English, French, American&mdash;who
have followed in the footsteps of Humboldt and his <i lang=
"fr">compagnon de voyage</i>, Bonpland, and who have cast a flood of
light upon the fauna and flora of the countries visited, and
supplemented the works of the early historians and missionaries by
describing the condition of their inhabitants as it obtains to-day.</p>
<p>In the following pages the author has endeavored to give not only
his own impressions of the lands he has visited but also, when the
narrative permitted or required it, the impressions of
others&mdash;conquistadores, missionaries and men of science&mdash;who
have gone over the same grounds or discussed the same topics as
constitute the subject-matter of this volume. The rapidly increasing
interest of our people in all matters pertaining to South America, and
the eagerness now manifested to see closer trade-relations established
between the United States and the various republics of Latin America,
seemed to justify this course. For the student, as well as for the
general reader, it seemed to be desirable, if not necessary, to
indicate, at least cursorily, by citations and footnotes, the character
and extent of that large class of works, historical and scientific,
that occupy so important a position in the annals of discovery and of
material and intellectual progress.</p>
<p>In the words of Pliny, quoted on the title page, it has been the aim
of the author &ldquo;to give newness to old things, authority to new
things, beauty to things out of use, fame to the obscure, favor to the
hateful, credit to the doubtful, nature to all and all to
nature.&rdquo; A difficult task truly; how difficult no one can more
fully recognize than the author himself. If he has failed in many of
the things proposed, he cherishes the hope that the reader&rsquo;s
verdict will incline to that contained in the last sentence of the
paragraph cited: &ldquo;To such neverthelesse as can not attayne to all
these, it is greatly commendable and magnificall to have attempted the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present book will be followed by a volume to be entitled:
&ldquo;Along the Andes and Down the Amazon.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On a dark, cold day toward the close of January, 1907,
the writer stood at a window in New York, observing some score of a
mittened army removing the avalanche of snow that cumbered the streets
after a half week of continuous storm. He was pondering a long
vacation, musing where rest and recreation might be found, at once
wholesome and instructive, amid scenes quite different from any
afforded by his previous journeys. He was familiar with every place of
interest in North America, from Canada to the Gulf, from Alaska to
Yucatan. He had spent many years in Europe, had visited Asia, Africa,
and the far-off isles of the Pacific. He cared not to revisit these,
much less to go where he must entertain or be entertained. He sought
rest, absolute rest and freedom, untrammeled by conventional life. For
the present he would shun the society of his fellows for the serene
solitude of the wilderness, or the companionship of mighty mountains
and rivers. Not that he was a misanthrope or that he wished to become
an anchoret. Far from it. Still less did he wish to spend his time in
idleness. This for him would have been almost tantamount to solitary
confinement. He dreamed of a land where he could spend most of the time
in the open air close to Nature and in communion with her&mdash;where
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>both mind and body could be always active and yet
always free&mdash;free as the bird that comes and goes as it lists.</p>
<p>Whilst thus absorbed in thought, and casting an occasional glance at
the laborers in the street battling against the Frost-King, whose work
continued without intermission, the writer was awakened from his
reverie by the dulcet notes evoked from a Steinway grand and the sweet,
sympathetic voice of one who had just intoned the opening words of
Goethe&rsquo;s matchless song as set to music by Liszt:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Knowest thou the land where the pale citron
grows,</p>
<p class="line">And the gold orange through dark foliage glows?</p>
<p class="line">A soft wind flutters through the deep blue sky,</p>
<p class="line">The myrtle blooms, and towers the laurel high,</p>
<p class="line">Knowest thou it well?</p>
<p class="line"><span class="hemistich">Knowest thou it well?</span> O
there with thee!</p>
<p class="line">O that I might, my own beloved one, flee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It was La Ni&ntilde;a&mdash;the pet name of the young
musician&mdash;that came as a special providence to clear up a question
that seemed to be growing more difficult the longer it was pondered.
The effect was magical, and all doubt and hesitation disappeared
forthwith. La Ni&ntilde;a, as if inspired, had, without in the least
suspecting it, indicated the land of the heart&rsquo;s desire. Yes, the
writer would leave, and leave at once, the region of cloud and frost
and chilling blast, and seek the land of flowers and sunshine, the land
of &ldquo;soft wind&rdquo; and &ldquo;blue sky,&rdquo; &ldquo;the land
where the pale citron grows,&rdquo; where &ldquo;the gold orange
glows.&rdquo; It would not, however, be the land of which Mignon sang
and which she so yearned to see again. Lovely, charming Italy, with its
manifold attractions of every kind, must for once yield to the sun-land
of another clime far away, and in another hemisphere.</p>
<p>A few days afterwards the writer, with a few friends, had taken his
place in a through Pullman car bound for the Land of Easter&mdash;the
land of Ponce de Leon. They found every <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>berth in the car occupied by
people like themselves hastening away from the rigors of winter and
betaking themselves to where</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Trees bloom throughout the year, soft breezes
blow,</p>
<p class="line">And fragrant Flora wears a lasting smile.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Some were going for the rest and the amusement
promised at several noted winter resorts. Others were in search of
health that had been shattered by confinement or over-work. Some were
going away for a few weeks only; others for the entire winter. Some
were going no farther south than Florida, others purposed visiting some
of the Antilles, and even, mayhap, the Spanish Main.</p>
<p>As for the writer, he had no fixed plan, and for this reason he had
not even thought of making out an itinerary. He would go to Florida to
take up again a line of travel that had been interrupted some decades
before. He had always been interested in the lives and achievements of
the early Spanish discoverers and conquistadores, and had, in days gone
by, followed in the footsteps of Narvaez and de Soto, of Cabeza de Vaca
and Coronado, Fray Marcos de Niza, and Hernando Cortes. And now that he
had the opportunity, it occurred to him that he could do nothing better
or more profitable than make a reality what had been a dream from
boyhood. He would visit the islands and lands discovered by the
immortal &ldquo;Admiral of the ocean sea&rdquo; and follow in the
footsteps of the conquistadores in Tierra Firme. He would explore the
lands first made known by Balboa, and Quesada, and Belalcazar and
rendered famous by the prowess of the Almagros and the Pizarros. He
would visit the homes of the Musicas, the Incas, and the Ayamaras,
wander among the Cordilleras from the Caribbean Sea to Lake Titicaca
and beyond, and follow in the wake of Diego de Ordaz and Alonzo de
Herrera on the broad waters of the Orinoco and in that of Pedro de
Orsua and Francisco de Orellana in the mighty flood of the Amazon.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>A great undertaking apparently, and, considered in the light of
certain reports published about tropical America, seemingly impossible.
To say the least, such a journey, it was averred, implied difficulties
and privations and dangers innumerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to spend the rest of your life in South America?
It will require a lifetime to visit the regions you have mentioned. I
have myself spent many years in traveling in tropical America, and
knowing, as I do, the lack of facilities for travel, the countless
unforeseen delays of every kind, and the <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i> habit
that obtains everywhere in the countries you would visit, I have no
hesitation in stating that you are attempting the impossible, if you
mean to accomplish all you have spoken of in the limited time you have
allotted to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the words addressed to the writer on the eve of his
departure by a noted traveler and one who is considered an authority on
all things South American. Not very encouraging, truly, especially to
one who was seeking rest and recreation and who was anything but
inclined to court hardships and dangers in foreign lands and among
peoples that were reputed to be only half-civilized, where-ever they
chanced to be above the aboriginal savage that still roams over so much
of the territory on both sides of the equator.</p>
<p>But, as already stated, the writer had on leaving home no definite
programme mapped out. He left that to shape itself according to events
and circumstances. He departed on his journey with little more of a
plan than the vague indications of a life-long dream. Still, confiding
in Providence, he hoped that he would be able to realize this, as he
had, in years gone by, realized other dreams that seemed even less
likely ever to become actualities.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Twenty-eight hours after leaving New York, with its
snow and ice and arctic blasts, our party found itself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>wandering
among the orange groves and promenading beneath the graceful palms of
old, romantic St. Augustine. We could scarcely credit our senses, so
complete was the change in our environment. A soft, balmy atmosphere,
gentle zephyrs, sweet, feathered songsters without number, all joining
in a chorus of welcome to the strangers from the North, made us think
that we had been transported to the Hesperides or to the delights of
the Elysian Fields. And when, after nightfall, we walked about the
grounds and the courts of the famous hostelries that have been recently
erected regardless of expense, and provided with every luxury that
money and art can command&mdash;all brilliantly illuminated by
thousands of electric lights of divers colors&mdash;it seemed as if we
had, in very deed, suddenly, we knew not how, become denizens of
fairyland. To find anything similar to the scene that here bursts upon
the view of the delighted visitor one must go to Monte Carlo during the
season when thousands are attracted thither from all parts of the
world, or betake oneself to the Place de la Concorde when the gay
French capital is <i>en f&ecirc;te</i>.</p>
<p>St. Augustine, with all its traditions and historic associations, is
one of the most restful and interesting of places, especially in
winter, and a place, too, where one might tarry for months with
pleasure. Nothing can be more delightful than the drives in the
pine-forests adjacent to the city,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Where west-winds with musky wing</p>
<p class="line">About the cedarn alleys fling</p>
<p class="line">Nard and cassias balmy smells.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">We could now verify at our leisure what we had been
wont to consider as the exaggerated statements of the early explorers
of Florida regarding the beautiful forests&mdash;&ldquo;trellised with
vines and gay with blossoms&rdquo;&mdash;and the fragrant odors that
were wafted from them by the breeze even out to the ships passing along
the coast, and &ldquo;in such abundance that the entire orient could
not produce so much.&rdquo; &ldquo;We stretched forth our hands,&rdquo;
writes Lescarbot, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>in his <i lang="fr">Historie de la Nouvelle
France</i>, &ldquo;as if to grasp them, so palpable were they.&rdquo;
All carried away with them the same impression about the
&ldquo;<i lang="fr">douceur odoriferante de <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e700" title="Source: plusiers">plusieurs</span> bonnes
choses</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the odoriferous sweetness of many good
things&mdash;that was everywhere observable.</p>
<p>Nor were their accounts of this grateful feature of the country
overdrawn. It is the same to-day as it was four centuries ago, when the
European had just landed on these shores and found so many
things&mdash;as novel as they were marvelous&mdash;to excite his
delight and enthusiasm. It is something that is denied to us whose
homes are in the North, and, to enjoy it in all its newness and
freshness, we must perforce immigrate to tropical and subtropical
climes.</p>
<p>But the foregoing is only one of the delectable features of this
favored land. As we wander through the groves and gardens and sail on
the placid waters of the rivers and lakes through the silent everglades
or the dark and mysterious forests, we find at every turn something to
charm the ear or delight the eyes. Everywhere we meet with new and
beauteous form of animal and vegetable life and realize for the first
time, perhaps, how diverse and multitudinous are the forms of animated
nature.</p>
<p>If we are to credit Herrera, it was on account of its beautiful
aspect, as well as on the day on which it was discovered, that the
locality received the name it now bears. The historian says explicitly
that Ponce de Leon and his companions &ldquo;named it Florida because
it appeared very delightful, having many pleasant groves, and it was
all level; as also because they discovered it at Easter, which, as has
been said, the Spaniards call Pascua de Flores or
Florida.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e710src" href="#xd21e710"
name="xd21e710src">1</a></p>
<p>In view of this clear and positive statement of Herrera, one is
surprised to see that writers treating the subject <i>ex professo</i>
have fallen into error regarding the origin of the name Florida. Thus
Barnard Shipp writes: &ldquo;The Peninsula of Florida was discovered by
Juan Ponce de Leon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>on Pascua Florida, Palm Sunday, in the year
1512,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e720src" href="#xd21e720" name=
"xd21e720src">2</a> and because of the day on which he discovered it,
he gave it the name Florida.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e731src"
href="#xd21e731" name="xd21e731src">3</a></p>
<p>All doubt, however, about the real origin of the name, about which
there has been so much misunderstanding, is removed by the declaration
of Peter Martyr, the father of American history. In his delightfully
refreshing work, <i>De Orbe Novo</i>, which is not so well known as it
should be, he asserts in language that does not admit of ambiguity,
that Juan Ponce named the newly discovered territory Florida because it
was discovered the day of the Resurrection, for the Spaniards call the
day of the Resurrection <i>Pascua de Flores</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e744src" href="#xd21e744" name=
"xd21e744src">4</a></p>
<p>When the French Huguenots some decades later attempted to colonize
the country they called it &ldquo;La Nouvelle France&rdquo;&mdash;New
France&mdash;a name they also subsequently gave to Canada.</p>
<p>More interesting, however, is the fact that the Spaniards first
thought the peninsula to be an island and called it Isla Florida. Ponce
de Leon in writing to Charles V calls it an island, and it is figured
as such in the Turin map of the New World, circa 1523. But after they
learned that it was the mainland, Florida was made to embrace the whole
of North America except Mexico. Thus writes Herrera and Las Casas. The
latter make it extend from what we now know as Cape Sable to &ldquo;the
land of Codfish&rdquo; (Newfoundland), &ldquo;otherwise known as
Labrador, which is not very far from the island of England.&rdquo; The
present boundaries of Florida, it may be remarked, were not determined
until 1795, when they were fixed by treaty with Spain. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>But what in more interesting than names and boundaries, and what
will, perhaps, be more surprising to the readers of popular works on
the subject, is the fact that Ponce de Leon, in spite of all that has
been said to the contrary, was not the discoverer of Florida, the fact
that it was discovered nearly two decades before Ponce de Leon reached
its shores, and the further and more unexpected fact that it was
discovered by that much misrepresented and much abused navigator,
Americus Vespucius.</p>
<p>Thanks to the researches of Varnhagen, Harrisse and others, these
facts have been apparently demonstrated beyond doubt. In his work on
the voyages of the brothers Cortereal, Harrisse has clearly proven
that, between the end of the year 1500 and the summer of 1502, certain
navigators, whose names and nationality are unknown, but who were
presumably Spaniards, discovered, explored and named that part of the
coast-line of the United States which extends from Pensacola Bay, along
the Gulf of Mexico, to the Cape of Florida, and, turning it, runs
northward along the Atlantic coast to about the mouth of the Chesapeake
or the Hudson.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e757src" href="#xd21e757"
name="xd21e757src">5</a> The maps of Juan de la Cosa&mdash;drawn in
1500&mdash;and the one made for Alberto Cantino in 1502&mdash;maps
which have only recently received the attention due them&mdash;are
overwhelming evidence of the truth of these conclusions.</p>
<p>According to M. Varnhagen, the one who furnished the data for these
maps, if indeed, he did not construct the prototype from which they
were both executed, was no other than Americus Vespucius, who from now
on must receive different treatment from that which has hitherto been
accorded him. By <span class="corr" id="xd21e764" title=
"Source: marshaling">marshalling</span> a brilliant array of facts,
presented with masterly logic, Varnhagen, silences the detractors of
the illustrious Florentine navigator, and disarms those objectors who
have been unwilling to accept as true the statements contained in the
celebrated Soderini letter regarding his first voyage to the New World
in 1497 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>and 1498. He leaves no doubt on the reader&rsquo;s
mind, that Vespucius, after visiting Honduras and Yucatan, sailed
thence to and around Florida, and that, if he did not himself actually
construct the original of the Cantino map, it was he that supplied the
data from which both this map and that of Juan de la Cosa were rendered
possible.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e769src" href="#xd21e769" name=
"xd21e769src">6</a> If some fortunate student of early <i>Americana</i>
should eventually ferret out the <i>Quattro Giornate</i>&mdash;Four
Journeys&mdash;of which Vespucius frequently makes mention, and in
which he gives an account of all his voyages, he would render an
incalculable service to the cause of truth, and would be able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of even the most exacting critic the
extent and importance of the services rendered by the pilot major of
Spain to the crown of Leon and Castile&mdash;services only second to
those which distinguish Columbus himself.</p>

<p class="first">But whatever may be said about the discovery of the
country, Ponce de Leon&rsquo;s name will always remain so closely
linked with Florida that it will never be possible to dissociate the
two. One may forget all about his enterprise as a navigator and may
ignore his claims as a discoverer, but one can never become oblivious
of that strange episode with which his name is inseparably
connected&mdash;the romantic search for the Fountain of Youth.</p>
<p>For the historian, as for the psychologist, the subject possesses an
abiding interest, and even the casual visitor to Florida finds himself
unconsciously dreaming about the days long gone by when Spaniard and
Indian were wandering through forest and everglade in search of the
life-giving fountain about which they had heard such marvelous reports.
And if his dreams do not consume all his time, he also finds himself
speculating on the origin of such reports, or the basis of the legend
which started Ponce de <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>Leon and others on a search for what proved
to be an <i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> as extraordinary as was the
mythical Eldorado a few years later.</p>
<p>The historian Gomara, referring to this episode in the life of Ponce
de Leon, writes as follows: &ldquo;The gouernour of the Islande of
Boriquena, John Ponce de Leon, beinge discharged of his office and very
ryche, furnysshed and sente foorth two carvels to seeke the Ilandes of
Boyuca in the which the Indians affirmed to be a fontayne or spring
whose water is of vertue to make owlde men younge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whyle he trauayled syxe monethes with owtragious desyre among
many Ilandes to fynde that he sought, and coulde fynde no token of any
such fountayne, he entered into Bimini and discouered the lande of
Florida in the yeare 1512 on Easter day which the Spanyardes caule the
florisshing day of Pascha, wherby they named that lande
Florida.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e796src" href="#xd21e796"
name="xd21e796src">7</a></p>
<p>Antonio de Herrera speaks not only of this Fountain of Youth but
also of a river whose waters had likewise the marvelous property of
restoring youth to old age. This river was also supposed to be in
Florida. It was known as the Jordan and received quite as much
attention from both Spaniards and Indians as did the Fountain of
Youth.</p>
<p>Fonteneda, who spent seventeen years in the wilds of Florida, as a
captive of the Indians, gives more explicit information about the
subject than either Gomara or Herrera. &ldquo;Juan Ponce de
Leon,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;believing the reports of the Indians of
Cuba and San Domingo to be true, made an expedition into Florida to
discover the river Jordan. This he did, either because he wished to
acquire renown, or, perhaps, because he hoped to become young again by
bathing in its waters. Many years ago a number of Cuban Indians went in
search of this river, and entered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>the province of Carlos, but
Sequene, the father of Carlos, took them prisoners and settled them in
a village, where their descendants are still living. The news that
these people had left their own country to bathe in the river Jordan
spread among all the kings and chiefs of Florida, and, an they were an
ignorant people, they set out in search of this river, which was
supposed to possess the powers of rejuvenating old men and women. So
eager were they in their search, that they did not pass a river, a
brook, a lake, or even a swamp, without bathing in it, and even to this
day they have not ceased to look for it, but always without success.
The natives of Cuba, braving the dangers of the sea, became the victims
of their faith, and thus it happened that they came to Carlos, where
they built a village. They came in such great numbers that, although
many have died, there are still many living there, both old and young.
While I was a prisoner in those parts I bathed in a great many rivers
but never found the right one.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e813src" href="#xd21e813" name="xd21e813src">8</a></p>
<p>The poet-historian, Juan de Castellanos, writing in mock heroic
style, says that so great were the virtues of the Fountain of Youth,
that by means of its waters old women were able to get rid of their
wrinkles and gray hairs. &ldquo;A few draughts of the water and a bath
in the restoring fluid sufficed to restore strength to their enfeebled
members, give beauty to their features, and impart to a faded
complexion the glow of youth. And, considering the vanity of our times,
I wonder how many old women would drag themselves to this saving wave,
if the puerilities of which I speak were certainties. How rich and
puissant would not be the king who should own such a fountain! What
farms, jewels, and prized treasures would not men sell in order to
become young again! And what cries of joy would not proceed from the
women-folk&mdash;from the fair as well as from the homely! In what a
variety of costumes and liveries would not all go to seek such favors!
Certainly they would take <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href=
"#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>greater pains than they would in
making a visit to the Holy Land.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e822src" href="#xd21e822" name="xd21e822src">9</a></p>
<p>What Castellanos said might be repeated to-day. If the Fountain of
Youth or the river Jordan, such as Ponce de Leon, Ayllon and de Soto
sought, now existed, Florida would be the most frequented and most
thickly populated country on the face of the globe. Vichy, Homburg,
Karlsbad and other similar resorts would at once be abandoned, and
there would forthwith be a mad rush for the Land of Easter. The
Fountain of Youth would be worth more to its possessor than the diamond
mines of Kimberley, more than the combined interests of Standard Oil,
more than all the stocks and bonds of the United States Steel
Corporation. There would be countless numbers who, like Faust, would be
ready to sell their souls for a single draught of the life-giving
fountain, for a single plunge into the health- and strength-restoring
river.</p>
<p>That the simple and ignorant Indians of Cuba and Haiti and adjacent
islands should have credited the stories in circulation about the
marvelous waters said to exist somewhere in Florida we can understand.
The marvelous and the supernatural always appeal in a special manner to
the superstitious and untutored savage. We are, however, disposed to
smile at the credulity of the enlightened Spaniard who did not hesitate
to sacrifice fortune and life in the quest of what could never be found
outside of Utopia. But, viewing things in our present state of
knowledge, it is easy to judge them rashly and do them a grave
injustice. We must transport ourselves back to the times in which they
lived and acted, and consider the strange and novel environment in
which they suddenly found themselves. A <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e840" title="Source: now">new</span> world had just been
discovered&mdash;a world in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>everything&mdash;plants, trees,
animals, men&mdash;seemed different from what they were familiar with
in their own land. And for a people who from their youth had eagerly
listened to stories of knight-errantry, and who, by long association
with their Moorish neighbors, were ready to accept as sober facts the
wildest statements of oriental fable, a special allowance must be made.
They had heard of the adventures of Marco Polo, and of the wonders of
Cathay and Cipango, and their minds were full of the oft-told tales
about the Fortunate Isles, and the Islands of the Blest&mdash;located
somewhere in the broad Atlantic, and presumably in the region of the
setting sun&mdash;and what more natural than that they should expect to
find themselves some bright morning in a land of enchantment? The
marvelous stories current about the voyages of St. Brendan and his
companions, about the island in the Western sea inhabited by Enoch and
Elias, about the Garden of Eden moved from the distant East to the more
distant West, all contributed to prepare their minds for a ready
acceptance of the most extravagant statements. Had not the great
Admiral, Columbus, announced that he had located the site of the
Terrestrial Paradise, when he sailed by the rushing water of the
Orinoco, and had not his views been accepted by thousands of his
wondering contemporaries?</p>
<p>Such being the case, is it astonishing that the early explorers
should have seriously believed in what we are now so ready to denounce
as absurd? The romantic world of the sixteenth century, when Pliny and
the <i>Physiologus</i> and the <i>Bestiaries</i>, were accepted by
students of nature as unquestioned authorities; when learned men spent
their lives in search of the elixir of life and the philosopher&rsquo;s
stone, and believed in the transmutation of the baser metals into gold,
was quite different from our prosaic twentieth-century world, when
nothing is accepted that cannot pass the ordeal of exact science.</p>
<p>Again, we must not imagine, as is so often done, that a <i>Fons
Juventutis</i>, such as Ponce de Leon and his contemporaries
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>sought for, was something unheard of in the
history of our race. Stories of miraculously healing fountains have
been current from early times and in divers parts of the world&mdash;in
India, in Ethiopia, and in the isles of the Pacific.</p>
<p>The reader will recall what Sir John Mandeville says about a well of
youth he found during his travels in India. It was, he declares,
&ldquo;a right faire and a clere well, that hath a full good and sweete
savoure, and it smelleth of all maner of sortes of spyces, and also at
eche houre of the daye it changeth his savor diversely, and whoso
drinketh thries on the daye of that well, he is made hole of all maner
of sickenesse that he hathe. I have sometime dronke of that well and me
thinketh yet that I fare the better; some call it the well of youth,
for they that drinke thereof seme to be yong alway, and live without
great sicknesse, and they saye this, cometh from Paradise terrestre,
for it is so vertuous.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e863src" href=
"#xd21e863" name="xd21e863src">10</a></p>
<p>So writes Mandeville, but there is reason to believe that he cribbed
this account of the Fountain of Youth from a medieval legend of Prester
John, from which, on account of the interest that attaches to the
subject, I select the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Item aboute this passage is a fonteyne or a conduyte so who
of this watere drinked, IIJ. tymes he shall waxe yonge and also yf a
man haue had a sykenes, XXX. yere and drynked of thys same water he
shall therof be hole and sonde. And also as a man thereof drinked hym
semeth that he had occupyed the beste mete and drinke of the worlde,
and this same fonteyne is full of the grace of the holy goost, and who
sowe in this same water wasshed his body he shall become yonge of XXX.
yere.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e872src" href="#xd21e872" name=
"xd21e872src">11</a></p>
<p>Whether these stories had their origin in folklore or not, they
found their way into Europe at least two centuries before the voyage of
Ponce de Leon to Florida. Mandeville&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>work
appeared in French, Latin, and English, and such was its popularity,
that Halliwell did not hesitate to declare that &ldquo;of no book, with
the exception of the Scriptures, can more MSS. be found at the end of
the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such being the case, it would be strange indeed if the Spaniards
were not familiar with stories so widely circulated, and stranger still
if, on arriving in the New World, and learning from the Indians of the
existence of a fountain of youth, and at no great distance away, they
should not seek to locate it and test its virtues. Given the state of
knowledge at the time, and the credence accorded to the accounts of
similar fountains in the Old World, the much ridiculed expedition of
Ponce de Leon followed as a natural consequence. It would have been
more surprising if the expedition had not been made than that it was
made.</p>
<p>The foregoing remarks on the Florida Fountain of Youth and river
Jordan would be incomplete without a few words about the probable
origin of the traditions concerning them. To attribute their origin to
folklore simply may be true, but it explains nothing.</p>
<p>M. E. Beauvois, in a series of interesting articles&mdash;very
plausible if not conclusive&mdash;on the subject, contends that all the
traditions regarding the Fountain of Youth and the river Jordan, which
proved so attractive to the Spaniards, are of Christian origin. He
maintains that the Gaels, as early as 1380, &ldquo;had established
relations with the aborigines from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the
tropical zone of North America, and that it is very probable that
missionaries accompanied the merchants in their voyages to Florida and
the Antilles.&rdquo; He argues that these missionaries baptized the
indigenes in some river which, for that reason, they called the Jordan,
or that they spoke to them of a river in their country, on which a
Christian mission had been established, and that this fact gave rise to
the formation of the tradition of a Jordan situated somewhere at the
north of the Antilles. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>It remains to show how this tradition came to be confounded with the
story of the Fountain of Youth. This confusion was the more natural
that the same idea is at the foundation of the two parallel traditions.
The one has reference to the regeneration of the soul, the other to the
rejuvenation of the body, both being effected by means of vivifying
water. In the beginning, but one kind of water was known, that
&ldquo;which saved by its own proper virtue, the water of baptism,
which is exclusively spiritual.&rdquo; Subsequently, however, the
simple and superstitious Indian attributed to the waters of baptism
properties which seemed to him preferable to those spoken of by the
missionary&mdash;the properties, namely, &ldquo;of curing diseases of
the body, or of restoring youth to the decrepit and of indefinitely
prolonging life. From that time the Fountain of Youth had a proper
existence and began to play an important role in popular
traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long the tradition of the beneficent waters of Florida
existed&mdash;and Florida, it must be remembered, meant to the
Spaniards of the sixteenth century all the Atlantic coast&mdash;M.
Beauvois does not determine. It may have been only a few generations,
or it may have been several centuries. It may even have dated back to
about the year 1008, when Thorfinn Karlsefni was baptized in
&ldquo;Vinland the Good&rdquo;&mdash;Massachusetts&mdash;the first
Christian, so far as known, born on the American continent. Or it may
have originated as far north as New Brunswick&mdash;&ldquo;Great
Ireland or Huitramannaland&mdash;which had been occupied by a Gaelic
colony from the year 1000, or from an earlier date, until the end of
the fourteenth century, and where, about the year 1000, the Papas,
Columbite monks, the evangelizers of that region, had baptized the
Icelander, Ar&eacute; M&acirc;rsson, who had left his native island
before his conversion to Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At all events, whatever conclusions may be reached as to the time
when and the place where the tradition originated, it is manifest that
&ldquo;it could have been propagated <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>in the New World only by
Christians and as it was in existence before the arrival of the
Spaniards, we must attribute its propagation to other Europeans, to
those, for example, whose crosses the indigenes of Tennessee and
Georgia had exhumed from their ancient burial places, or to those whom
the inhabitants of Haiti had known either <i>de visu</i> or by
hearsay.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e897src" href="#xd21e897"
name="xd21e897src">12</a></p>
<p>What is here said of the Christian origin of the Florida Fountain of
Youth can likewise be predicated of the one mentioned in the legend of
Prester John&mdash;whence, as we have seen, Mandeville got his story,
for it is said, &ldquo;this same fonteyne is full of the grace of the
holy goost,&rdquo; an obvious allusion to the regenerating waters of
baptism.</p>
<p>But it is time to resume the thread of our narrative, interrupted by
a discussion unavoidably long, but pardonable, it is hoped, in view of
its abiding interest and intimate connection with the early history of
Florida. Besides, my purpose is not so much to give descriptions of the
countries through which we shall pass&mdash;something which has in most
instances been done before&mdash;as to give the impressions of their
earliest explorers and to dwell, as briefly as may be, on topics
relating to the various regions visited, that possess even for the most
casual reader a perennial fascination and importance. In countries like
those we shall visit, the impressions of the first explorers are often
more interesting and instructive than those of the latest tourist or
naturalist, for such impressions have about them a freshness and an
originality&mdash;often a quaintness and a simplicity&mdash;that are
entirely absent from modern works of travel. Another reason for so
doing is that much of the ground, over which we shall travel, is
practically the same to-day as when it first greeted the eyes of the
conquistadores, and many of the towns and cities we shall visit, no
less than the manners and customs of the people, differ but little
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>from what they were in the time of Charles V and
Philip II. Thus, regarding many things, the statements of the Spanish
writers and missionaries of four centuries ago are still as true as if
they had been penned but yesterday, and that, too, by the most accurate
observer.</p>
<p>From St. Augustine, the oldest city in the United States, the
traveler has the choice of two routes to Havana. One is by way of Tampa
Bay, called by De Soto the Bay of Esp&iacute;ritu Santo, and by some of
the early geographers designated as the Bay of Ponce de Leon. What,
however, is now known as Ponce de Leon Bay, is farther south and near
the southernmost point of the peninsula. The other route is along the
east coast of the state. At the time of our visit the railroad was in
operation only as far as Miami, but was being rapidly pushed towards
its terminus at Key West.</p>
<p>We chose the eastern route because we could in fancy follow more
closely in the footsteps of the conquistadores and picture to
ourselves, in the ocean, nearly always visible, that long procession of
barks and brigantines which four centuries ago plowed the main, some
moving northward, others southward&mdash;all manned by brawny, hardy
mariners in search of gold and glory. Spaniards, like Ponce de Leon and
Pedro Menendez; Italians, like Americus Vespucius and Verrazano;
<span class="corr" id="xd21e917" title=
"Source: Englishman">Englishmen</span>, like Hawkins and Raleigh;
Frenchmen, like Ribaut and Laudonniere, all passed along this
coast&mdash;all bent on achieving distinction or extending the
possessions of their respective sovereigns. Brave and gallant mariners
these, men whose names are writ large on the pages of story and who
occupy a conspicuous place in the records of the heroes of
adventure.</p>
<p>From Miami we went by steamer to Key West, which will soon be
accessible by rail from St. Augustine. The sea was as placid as an
inland lakelet and the voyage to Havana was in every way ideal. We
skirted along the Florida Keys&mdash;those countless coral islets that
are to serve as piers for the railroad under construction, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>is to form so important a link between Cuba and
the United States. When completed the time consumed in going to the
Pearl of the Antilles will not only be greatly lessened, but the former
discomforts and terrors of the journey will be entirely eliminated. No
longer will the traveler be obliged to encounter the hurricanes of the
Bahamas or the heavy seas off Cape Hatteras. He will be able to take
his seat in a Pullman car in New York and go, without change, through
to Key West and thence to Havana and Santiago de Cuba.</p>
<p>How different was it when the small Spanish craft of four centuries
ago navigated these waters on their way from Panama and Vera Cruz to
the mother country! Then, as the reader will observe, by reference to
the old maps of Florida, the keys or coral reefs along the coast were
known as <i lang="es">Los M&aacute;rtires</i>&mdash;the
Martyrs&mdash;so named by Ponce de Leon on account of the number of
shipwrecks that occurred here, and because of the number of lives that
were lost on these treacherous shoals and also, as Herrera informs us,
because of certain rock-formations in the vicinity that have the
appearance of men in distress.</p>
<p>If we may credit the legends and traditions that have obtained in
those parts, many a Spanish treasure-ship has been lost in threading
its way through the uncharted shoals and islands of <i lang="es">Los
M&aacute;rtires</i> and the Bahamas, and many futile attempts have been
made to recover at least a part of the treasure lost, but it was</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Lost in a way that made search vain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And of the adventurous divers, who braved the dangers
of current and wave, one can safely say in the words of Bret Harte</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Never a sign,</p>
<p class="line">East or West, or under the line,</p>

<h3 class="main">THE PEARL OF THE ANTILLES</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early the morning following our departure from Miami
we were aroused from our slumbers by the cry of a mariner, &ldquo;Land
ho! all hands ahoy!&rdquo; We were on deck without delay, and there
before us, under a sky of purest azure, we beheld the hills of Cuba,
clad in a mantle of undying verdure. Its resplendent shores were
arrayed in hues of glowing beauty and unimagined loveliness. Fragrant
groves of orange and pomegranate, luxuriant forests white with clouds
of bloom, formed a glorious setting to the refulgent waves that
reflected the crimson splendors of the rising sun. Delicious zephyrs,
fanning their balmy wings, bathed our brows with dewy freshness, sweet
with perfume from ambrosial fruits and tropic flowers. Yes, we were in
the Pearl of the Antilles, the &ldquo;Sweet Isle of Flowers&rdquo;; in
<i>Gan Eden</i>&mdash;the Garden of Delight&mdash;that in the legends
of long ago was reckoned among the Isles of the Blest.</p>
<p>The beautiful pictures before us, however, were but as a fleeting
panorama. We had but little time to feast our eyes on them before we
were in front of grim, frowning Morro Castle, that for three centuries
and more has stood sentinel of the fair city at its feet. Adjoining the
Castle are the Caba&ntilde;as, a vast range of fortifications more than
a mile in length, and nearly a thousand feet in breadth. Just opposite,
on the other side of the harbor&rsquo;s entrance, is the Bateria de la
Punta, and some distance farther beyond is the star-shaped Castle
Atares. From a military standpoint Havana is well protected, and, with
Morro Castle properly equipped with modern artillery, would be
practically impregnable.</p>
<p>Few West Indian cities have greater historic interest than Havana.
From the time it was first visited by Ocampo, four hundred years ago,
until the raising of the flag of the Cuban Republic in 1904, it has
been the witness of many stirring events that have effected the
destinies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>of millions of people in various parts of the
world. It was from Havana&rsquo;s port that Cortes, in 1519, sailed on
his memorable voyage to Mexico. It was from this port that Pamphilio de
Narvaez and Hernando de Soto started on their ill-starred expeditions
to Florida. Time and again the city was harassed by Dutch, French and
English pirates and Buccaneers. Oftentimes, too, the daring sea-rovers,
who so long infested West Indian waters, levied tribute on the
unfortunate inhabitants who were unable to defend themselves. Indeed,
it was to defend the city from these marauders that the kings of Spain,
in the middle of the sixteenth century, began the erection of those
fortifications that, since their completion, have excited the
admiration of all who have visited them.</p>
<p>Cuba was one of the islands Columbus discovered during his first
voyage. But he thought he had discovered a continent&mdash;that he had
reached the eastern extremity of Asia. He had set out from Spain to
find a western route to the Indies, to offset the discoveries of
Bartholomew Diaz and Vasco <span class="corr" id="xd21e969" title=
"Source: de">da</span> Gama. To him Cuba was the land of the Great
Khan, far-off Cathay, and Espa&ntilde;ola, discovered shortly
afterwards, was Cipango, Japan. Indeed, there is reason to believe that
he died in the belief that Cuba, far from being an island, was a part
of China, as mapped by Toscanelli and described by Marco Polo. We have
no positive evidence that he was ever aware of the circumnavigation of
the island by Pinz&oacute;n and Sol&iacute;s in 1497, and he was dead
two years before its insularity was again proved by Ocampo. He never
dreamed that he had discovered a new world, nor did any of his
contemporaries or immediate successors have any conclusive reason to
infer that the lands discovered by the great Admiral in his third and
fourth voyages were not a part of the Asiatic continent.</p>
<p>Balboa&rsquo;s discovery of the Pacific Ocean did not supply such
reasons, neither did the rounding of South America and the
circumnavigation of the globe by Magellan. Nor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>were the
necessary proofs furnished by the explorations of Drake or Frobisher,
Davis or Hudson or Baffin.</p>
<p>The final demonstration of the complete separation of America from
Asia was a long process and was not given until the noted explorations
of Vitus Behring in 1728, more than two centuries after Balboa from the
summit of a peak in Darien first descried the placid waters of the
great South Sea.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e978src" href="#xd21e978"
name="xd21e978src">13</a></p>
<p>We had desired to visit the northern and southern coasts of Cuba,
and to feast our eyes on the beautiful scenes that had so captivated
Columbus; to view the hundred harbors that indent its tortuous shores;
to see the Queen&rsquo;s Gardens&mdash;now known as Los Cayos de las
Doce Leguas&mdash;which the great navigator fancied to be the seven
thousand spice islands of Marco Polo, but our time was too limited to
permit the long and slow coasting that would be required. Besides, we
preferred to study the interior of the country, and pass through the
sugar and tobacco plantations for which the island is so famous.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the comfort of the traveler, there is now a through
train from Havana to Santiago, so that one can make the entire five
hundred and forty miles in twenty-four hours, and that, too, if one so
elect, in a Pullman car.</p>
<p>Columbus, in writing of his first voyage to Rafael S&aacute;nchez
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>and <span class="corr" id="xd21e1008" title=
"Source: Lu&igrave;s">Luis</span> de Santangel, says that all the
countries he had discovered, but particularly Juana&mdash;the name he
gave to Cuba&mdash;&ldquo;are of surpassing excellence,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;exceedingly fertile.&rdquo; &ldquo;All these islands&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;are very beautiful and distinguished by a diversity
of scenery; they are filled with a great variety of trees of immense
height, and which I believe retain their foliage in all seasons; for
when I saw them&rdquo;&mdash;in November&mdash;&ldquo;they were as
verdant and luxuriant as they usually are in Spain in the month of
May&mdash;some of them were blossoming, some bearing fruit, and all
flourishing in the greatest perfection, according to their respective
stages of growth, and the nature and quality of each.&rdquo; Again he
writes, &ldquo;The nightingale and a thousand other sorts of birds were
singing in the month of November wherever I went. There are palm trees
in these countries of six or eight sorts, which are surprising to see,
on account of their diversity from ours, but, indeed, this is the case
with respect to the other trees, as well as the fruits and weeds. Here
are also honey, and fruits of a thousand sorts, and birds of every
variety.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1011src" href="#xd21e1011"
name="xd21e1011src">14</a></p>
<p>The Admiral&rsquo;s delight and enthusiasm at all he saw knew no
bounds, and in his diary he gives frequent expression to the
pleasurable emotions he experienced. All was new to him, and all
beautiful beyond words to describe. Trees and plants were as different
from those in Spain as day is from night, and the verdure and bloom in
November were as fresh and brilliant as in the month of May in
Andalusia.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1018src" href="#xd21e1018" name=
"xd21e1018src">15</a> The great navigator had a poet&rsquo;s love of
nature, and artist&rsquo;s eye for the beautiful. Indeed, it may be
truthfully said that no one since his time has more correctly and more
succinctly portrayed the salient features of these islands, and it may
be questioned if any one has more deeply appreciated their beauty and
splendor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>That which frequently arrests the attention of the traveler, on the
way from Havana to Santiago, is the numerous sugar and tobacco
plantations everywhere visible. Sugar cane, as is known, was not found
by the Spaniards on their arrival in the New World, but was introduced
there a short time after, most probably from the Madeira or Canary
Islands.</p>
<p>Tobacco, however, is an American plant, and one of the things that
most surprised the Europeans on first coming in contact with the
Indians of the newly discovered islands was to find them smoking the
dried leaves of this now favorite narcotic.</p>
<p>The first mention of tobacco is in Columbus&rsquo; diary under date
of November 6, 1492. Referring to two messengers he had sent out among
the Indians, he writes, &ldquo;The two Christians met on the road a
great many people going to their villages, men and women with brands in
their hands, made of herbs, for taking their customary
smoke.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1034src" href="#xd21e1034"
name="xd21e1034src">16</a> These, then, were the first cigars of which
we have any record. The use of tobacco in pipes was apparently first
observed in Florida by Captain John Hawkins during his voyage to the
peninsula in 1566. Among many other interesting things he tells us
about the inhabitants is that of their use and love of the pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Floridians when they trauel haue a kinde of herbe dryed,
which with a cane, and an earthen cup in the end, with fire, and the
dried herbs put together do sucke thoro the cane the smoke thereof,
which smoke satisfieth their hunger, and therewith they liue foure or
five days without meat or drinke, and this all the Frenchmen vsed for
this purpose; yet do they holde opinion withall, that it causeth water
and flame to void from their stomachs.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1041src" href="#xd21e1041" name="xd21e1041src">17</a></p>
<p>The early Italian traveler, Girolamo Benzoni, evidently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>did not
share the views of the Floridians and Frenchmen regarding the value of
tobacco. To him it was nothing less than an invention of Satan.
Speaking of its evil effects, he says, &ldquo;See what a pestiferous
and wicked poison from the devil this must be.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1050src" href="#xd21e1050" name="xd21e1050src">18</a></p>
<p>But it is the good Old Dominican, P&egrave;re Labat, who has the
most to say about the introduction and use of tobacco. His charming,
gossipy account of men and things and his <i>vagabunda loquacitas</i>,
have lost none of their fascination for the curious reader since they
were first written nearly two centuries ago.</p>
<p>Among other things he does not hesitate to affirm that the Indians,
&ldquo;by introducing the use of tobacco among their pitiless
conquerors, succeeded, in great measure, in avenging themselves for the
unjust servitude to which they had been reduced.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1063src" href="#xd21e1063" name=
"xd21e1063src">19</a> According to the good father, tobacco proved to
be a veritable apple of discord, because it gave rise to a protracted
war of words among men of science. In this war a large number of
ignoramuses as well as savants participated. And not the last to
declare themselves in favor of or opposed to what they understood no
better than the serious affairs of the day, in which they had been but
too active, were the woman-folk.</p>
<p>Physicians discussed its properties, nature and virtues, as if it
had been known all over the habitable world from the times of Galen,
Hippocrates, and &AElig;sculapius, and their opinions were as diverse,
and as opposed to one another as are to-day the opinions of allopaths
and homeopaths, osteopaths and psychopaths. They prescribed when and
how it was to be taken and in what doses. They and the chemists of the
time soon recognized in tobacco a valuable addition to their
pharmacop&oelig;a. Nay, more, it was not long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>before
it was proclaimed as a panacea for all the ills that poor suffering
humanity is heir to.</p>
<p>Its ashes cured glanders; taken as a powder it cured rheumatism,
headache, dropsy, and paralysis. It was a specific against melancholy
and insanity; against the smallpox and the plague, against fever,
asthma and liver troubles. It strengthened the memory and excited the
imagination, and philosophers and men of science could be, it was
averred, no better prepared to grapple with the most difficult of
abstract problems than by having the nose primed with snuff.</p>
<p>The effects induced by chewing tobacco were said to be even more
marvelous, for among other things it was claimed that by thus using it
hunger and thirst were allayed or prevented. It removed bile, cured
toothache and freed an over-charged brain from all kinds of deleterious
humors. It strengthened and preserved the sight. Oil, extracted from
tobacco, cured deafness, gout, sciatica, improved the circulation, and
was a tonic for the nervous. In a word, it was the great panacea of
which physicians and alchemists had so long dreamed, but had hitherto
been unable to find.</p>
<p>Finally, however, a reaction came. Books were written against it,
and kings and princes forbade its use. On the 26th of March, 1699, the
question was seriously discussed before <i lang="fr">L&rsquo;Ecole de
M&eacute;decine</i> whether the frequent use of tobacco shortened
life&mdash;<i lang="la">An ex tabaci usu frequenti vita summa
brevior?</i> And the conclusion was a demonstration that the frequent
use of tobacco did shorten life. <i lang="la">Ergo ex frequenti tabaci
usu vita summa brevior.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1086src" href=
"#xd21e1086" name="xd21e1086src">20</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>But notwithstanding the opinions of learned men and university
faculties regarding the alleged deleterious properties of tobacco, and
the denunciations hurled against the use of this invention of the Evil
One, the smoking of cigars and pipes soon became a general habit the
world over, and, it was at times difficult for the supply to meet the
demand. How little Las Casas dreamed that this &ldquo;vicious
habit,&rdquo; as he called it, was soon to become universal, and that
the time would come when young and old would regard the &ldquo;fragrant
weed,&rdquo; prepared in one way or another, not only as an
indispensable luxury, but also as a prime necessity&mdash;for rich and
poor alike, if life were to be worth living.</p>
<p>And how far was Columbus from imagining, when he saw the Indians
taking &ldquo;their customary smoke,&rdquo; that the leaves which they
had so carefully rolled together for this purpose, would eventually
prove to be one of the great staples of commerce, and one of the
world&rsquo;s most valued sources of revenue. He crossed &ldquo;the Sea
of Darkness&rdquo; to discover a direct route to the lands of spice and
the Golden Chersonese in order to fill the coffers of the land of his
adoption. He and his companions explored every island they met in their
wanderings in quest of gold and pearls and precious stones and here, in
the narcotic plant, that appeared to them as little more than a
curiosity, there were treasures greater than those of &ldquo;Ormus and
Ind.&rdquo; In this very island of Cuba, of whose charms he has left us
so glowing a picture, was in after years to be developed from the
humble plant&mdash;<i>Nicotiana Tabacum</i>&mdash;one of Spain&rsquo;s
most important industries&mdash;an industry that would, in the course
of time, contribute more to the nation&rsquo;s exchequer than the
combined output of the mines of Pasco and Potos&iacute;. Such was
evidently the thought of the Cuban poet, Zequeira, when, in his much
praised Horatian ode, <i lang="es">A La Pi&ntilde;a</i>, he sings</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&iexcl;Salve, suelo fel&iacute;z, donde

<p class="first">Santiago, like Havana, is a historic city, and, from
its foundation, nearly four centuries ago, until the memorable siege of
1898, it experienced many reverses at the hands of privateers and
pirates. We lingered just long enough to see its chief
attractions&mdash;there are not many&mdash;outside of the
Morro&mdash;and to get a view of the now famous El Caney and San Juan
Hill.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking below the horizon when we boarded the steamer
that was to take us to Haiti and Santo Domingo. As we passed under El
Morro, that has so long and faithfully guarded the entrance to the
placid harbor, and looked towards the setting sun where Cervera&rsquo;s
proud fleet was scattered, we could not but recall the prophetic words
of Las Casas penned in his last will and testament. Speaking of the
Indians, to whose care and protection he had devoted a long and
fruitful life, the holy bishop writes: &ldquo;As God is my witness that
I never had earthly interest in view, I declare it to be my conviction
and my faith&mdash;I believe it to be in accordance with the faith of
the Holy Roman Catholic Church, which is our rule and guide&mdash;that
by all the thefts, all the deaths, and all the confiscations of estates
and other uncalculable riches, by the dethroning of rulers with
unspeakable cruelty, the perfect and immaculate law of Jesus Christ and
the natural law itself have been broken, the name of our Lord and His
holy religion have been outraged, the spreading of the faith has been
retarded, and irreparable harm done to these innocent people. Hence I
believe that, unless it atones with much penance for these abominable
and unspeakably wicked deeds, Spain will be visited by the wrath of
God, because the whole nation has shared, more or less, in the bloody
wealth that has been acquired by the slaughter and extermination of
those people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>But I fear that it will repent too late, or never.
For God punishes with blindness the sins sometimes of the lowly, but
especially and more frequently the sins of those who think themselves
wise, and who presume to rule the world. We ourselves are eyewitnesses
of this darkening of the understanding. It is now seventy years since
we began to scandalize, to rob and to murder those peoples, but to this
day we have not come to realize that so many scandals, so much
injustice, so many thefts, so many massacres, so much slavery, and the
depopulation of so many provinces, which have disgraced our holy
religion, are sins or injustices at all.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1129src" href="#xd21e1129" name="xd21e1129src">22</a></p>
<p>Were the tragic scenes enacted in these waters and in the harbor of
Manila the fulfillment of the prophecy? If we should be disposed to
think so, let us not forget, in contemplating the humiliation and
punishment of Spain, that we too have sinned as Spain sinned. And let
us pray that the blood of the millions of Indians that have been
exterminated in our own land may not call down the vengeance of Heaven
on our children and our children&rsquo;s children. Nations, like
individuals, are punished where they have sinned.<a class="noteref" id=

<h3 class="main">HAITI AND SAN DOMINGO</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A short sail eastwards and we found ourselves crossing
the Windward Passage. Not far from our port quarter was Cape Maisi,
which Columbus, on his first voyage, named Cape Alpha and Omega, as
being the easternmost extremity of Asia; Alpha, therefore, from his own
point of view, and Omega from that of his Portuguese rivals. On his
second voyage Columbus came down through this passage to satisfy
himself that he had actually reached Mangi, the land of the Great Khan,
and coasted along the island of Cuba, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>as he reckoned, for a
thousand miles. But as fate would have it, he stopped short in his
westward course within a few hours&rsquo; sail of the present Cape San
Antonio, the westernmost promontory of the island. If he had only
journeyed on a few <span class="corr" id="xd21e1151" title=
"Source: knots">miles</span> further, he would have detected the
insularity of what he considered a continent, and thus have anticipated
the discoveries of Vespucius and Ocampo. And he would have done more.
He would have reached the shores of Yucatan and Campeachy and had an
opportunity of exploring the famous ruins of Chichen Itza and Uxmal.
How different, too, it would have been, if, after discovering
Guanahuani, he had directed the prow of the Santa Maria slightly to the
northwest, when a short sail would have brought him to the coast of
Florida! It is interesting to speculate not only how much his own life,
but also how greatly the entire course of American history would have
been affected by these slight changes in his course on these momentous
occasions.</p>
<p>But during his four voyages among these mysterious islands the great
navigator was as one groping his way in the Cretan labyrinth. On his
return eastward from the Cape of Good Hope&mdash;the name he gave to
the westernmost point of Cuba attained by him&mdash;he found, almost
before he was aware of it, that he had actually circumnavigated what he
had imagined to be Cipango, the great island of Japan. This surprised
and puzzled him beyond expression. Evidently, either he was mistaken or
the authorities on whom he had been relying were mistaken. If the
island&mdash;Espa&ntilde;ola&mdash;was not Cipango, what was it? He
soon learned that gold mines existed in the interior of the country and
that there was evidence of excavations that had been long
abandoned.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1156src" href="#xd21e1156" name=
"xd21e1156src">24</a> What more natural, then, than his conclusion that
this was the far-famed Ophir whence King Solomon had obtained the gold
used in the adornment of the temple of Jerusalem! <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whatever may be said of the Admiral&rsquo;s theory, one thing is
certain, and that is that the discovery of gold in
Espa&ntilde;ola<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1164src" href="#xd21e1164"
name="xd21e1164src">25</a> was directly or indirectly the cause of
untold misery to the aborigines, and eventually led up to the present
unfortunate condition of this hapless island. It was, as the reader
knows, the work in the mines that was the chief factor in the gradual
decimation and the final extinction of the Indians in Espa&ntilde;ola.
When there were no longer Indians to do the work, negroes were imported
from Africa, and thence dates that hideous period of cruel traffic in
human beings which, for more than three centuries, was the blackest
stain on the vaunted civilization of the Caucasian race. But in this,
as in other similar cases, an avenging Nemesis has either already
overtaken the offending nations or is giving them grave concern
regarding the future. In the black republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo
the slave has replaced the master, and there are already indications
that the day of reckoning is approaching for the powers that are in
control of the other islands of the West Indies. We saw evidences of
this during our visit in Cuba, and are convinced that, if it were not
for the strong arm of the United States, it would not be long before we
should have another black republic at our doors. And what is said of
Cuba may be said of all the islands of the Lesser Antilles from
Trinidad to Puerto Rico. The race question is one that will have to be
met sooner or later. The whites are decreasing in numbers and the
blacks are rapidly increasing and becoming more insistent on what they
claim to be their rights, especially to that of a greater
representation in government affairs, and to a larger share of the
emoluments of public office.</p>
<p>It was only a few years after the colonizing of Espa&ntilde;ola when
negro slavery was introduced into the island. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>motive
was, in some measure, a humane one&mdash;namely, to spare the Indians
the arduous labor in the mines for which they were physically
incapacitated. The African was much stronger and had much greater
powers of endurance than the native. According to Herrera, &ldquo;the
negroes flourished so well in Espa&ntilde;ola, that it was thought that
if a negro was not hanged he would never die, for no one had ever seen
one die of disease. Thus the negroes found, like the oranges, a soil in
Espa&ntilde;ola better suited to them than their own country,
Guinea.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1171src" href="#xd21e1171"
name="xd21e1171src">26</a></p>
<p>Monopolies of licenses were granted by the Spanish monarchs for the
importation of negro slaves to the West Indies, first to their own
subjects, and later on to certain Genoese and Germans, and finally, by
a special <i>asiento</i>, or contract, the Spanish government conveyed
to the English the &ldquo;exclusive right to carry on the most
nefarious of all trades between Africa and Spanish America.&rdquo; The
British engaged to transport annually to the Spanish Indies during a
term of thirty years, four thousand and eight hundred of what, in trade
language, were called &ldquo;Indian pieces,&rdquo; that is to say,
negro slaves, paying a duty per head of thirty-three escudos and
one-third.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1181src" href="#xd21e1181" name=
"xd21e1181src">27</a> So great was the number of negroes imported into
America from 1517, when Charles V first permitted the traffic, until
1807, when the slave trade was abolished by an act of the English
Parliament, that it has been computed that their total number was not
less than five or six millions. In one single year, 1768, it is said
that the number torn from their homes and country and transported to
Spain&rsquo;s new colonies was no less than ninety-seven
thousand.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1187src" href="#xd21e1187" name=
"xd21e1187src">28</a></p>
<p>But the inevitable soon came to pass&mdash;much sooner than even the
wisest statesman could have foreseen. The great Cardinal Ximenes, it is
true, realized from the beginning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>the risk incurred by sending
negroes to the Indies. He contended that it was wrong to send beyond
the ocean people so &ldquo;apt in war&rdquo; as the blacks, who might
at any time stir up a servile war against Spanish rule. He insisted
that &ldquo;the negroes, who were as malicious as they were strong,
would no sooner perceive themselves to be more numerous in the New
World than the Spaniards, than they would lay their heads together to
put on their masters the chains they now carried.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1197src" href="#xd21e1197" name=
"xd21e1197src">29</a></p>
<p>The cardinal&rsquo;s prediction soon came true. In all parts of the
Indies&mdash;in the islands of the sea and on Tierra Firme&mdash;there
were massacres and uprisings and &ldquo;servile wars,&rdquo; without
number, and both the colonies and the mother country had often occasion
to regret the introduction within their boundaries of so dangerous and
warlike subjects. But it was too late to rectify the mistake. It was
impossible to drive them out of the country, or to return them to the
land whence they had been brought against their will. So rapidly had
they increased in numbers that they now, in many places, constituted a
great majority of the population. Espa&ntilde;ola, to-day constituting
the two republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo, was the first island of
which they got supreme control. Which will be the next? The question is
not an idle one. It is one frequently asked in the West Indies. The
unrest and agitation of the blacks are much greater than we in the
North imagine. Their ambition is greater and their political
aspirations higher than those who have not been among them are prepared
to admit. The situation is certainly not one that justifies supine
indifference on the part of the governments now in control, nor is the
difficulty one whose solution can be indefinitely postponed. Every
lover <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>of law and order must hope that some <i lang=
"la">modus vivendi</i> can be arrived at whereby, while all the
legitimate claims of the negro are conceded, the world will he spared
another &ldquo;decline and fall&rdquo; like that which has been
witnessed in Espa&ntilde;ola.</p>
<p>We called at several of the ports of Haiti and Santo Domingo but we
found little to interest us outside of the capital of the latter
republic. Santo Domingo is not only the oldest city in the New
World&mdash;the early abandoned settlement of Isabella never deserved
the name of city&mdash;but is, in many respects, the most interesting.
Founded by Bartholomew Columbus in 1496, and named Santo Domingo after
the patron saint of his father, Domenico, it was, for a while, the seat
of the vice-royalty. It was to this place that Don Diego Colon, the son
of the Admiral, brought his lovely bride, Do&ntilde;a Maria de Toledo,
a daughter of one of the oldest and proudest families of Spain. Here he
set up a vice-regal court that excited the envy of his enemies, and was
by them made the basis of charges preferred against him that he
meditated establishing a government independent of the mother country.
Of the viceroy&rsquo;s palace, Oviedo writes to Charles V, it
&ldquo;<span lang="en-1600">seemeth unto me so magnificall and
princelyke that yowr maiestie maye bee as well lodged therin as in any
of the mooste exquisite builded houses of
Spayne.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1220src" href=
"#xd21e1220" name="xd21e1220src">30</a></p>
<p>From Santo Domingo radiated the lines of discovery and conquest that
culminated in the achievements of Cortes, Balboa and Pizarro. Here
Columbus was loaded with chains and imprisoned by Bobadilla. Here was
established the first university of the New World. Here, within the
walls of the Convent of San Domingo, prayed and labored that noble
&ldquo;Protector of the Indians,&rdquo; Las Casas, and here he planned
and began work on his monumental <i lang="es">Historia de las
Indias</i>. Until the last assault by Drake in 1586, it was the centre
of commercial activity in the Indies, for it was the chief port of call
to and from Spain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"
name="pb35">35</a>]</span>and the place where merchants, miners, and
planters disposed of their commodities and amassed fortunes.</p>
<p>But Santo Domingo&rsquo;s halcyon days were of short duration.
Before the end of the sixteenth century the city began to decline. The
theatre of activity, that had hitherto been confined to
Espa&ntilde;ola, was transferred to Cuba and Mexico, Panama and Peru,
and to-day the once gay and prosperous capital exhibits but a shadow of
its pristine glory.</p>
<p>Homenage Castle, the crumbling palace of Don Diego Columbus, and the
few churches and monasteries that still, even in their neglected
condition, attest the former importance of the place, present a
pathetic picture, and tell, in mute but elegant language, of the
reverses and evil days that have been the lot of America&rsquo;s first
city.</p>
<p>Besides the buildings just named we were especially interested in
the Cathedral. It is a noble structure and its interior decorations
compare favorably with similar edifices in Spain and Mexico. But there
was one attraction there that had for us, as it must have for all
Americans, a special interest, and which alone would well repay a
pilgrimage to Santo Domingo&mdash;the last resting place of the one
&ldquo;who to Castile and Leon gave a new world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the reader is aware, there has been a long and spirited
controversy as to the location of <i>los restos</i>&mdash;the
remains&mdash;of the illustrious discoverer. We have been shown his
sepulchre in the Cathedral of Havana, and in that of Seville, yet it
has been demonstrated beyond question that his ashes have never reposed
in either of these places. Without entering into details, it may now be
stated, as facts which no longer admit of any reasonable doubt, that
after his death in 1506, the remains of Columbus were interred in the
Franciscan monastery of Valladolid, whence, in 1508, they were
transferred to the monastery of Las Cuevas, at Seville. In 1541, at the
request of &ldquo;Do&ntilde;a Maria of Toledo, Vicereine of the Indies,
wife that was of the Admiral Don Diego Columbus,&rdquo; Charles V, by a
special cedula, granted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>permission for the transfer of the
remains of Christopher Columbus to Espa&ntilde;ola, to be interred in
the capilla mayor of the Cathedral of Santo Domingo. Here they have
since reposed, with the exception of the short time during which they
were kept in the adjoining church, when the Cathedral was undergoing
certain necessary repairs in 1877 and 1878. The supposed remains of the
first Admiral, that were taken to Havana in 1795, and finally
transferred to Seville in 1899, have been shown to be those of his son,
Don Diego, who, together with Don Luis Columbus, the third Admiral, and
the first Duke of Veragua, was also buried in the capilla mayor of the
Cathedral, where the remains of Don Luis still lie near those of his
illustrious grandfather.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1247src" href=
"#xd21e1247" name="xd21e1247src">31</a></p>
<p>As our steamer moved out of the water of Santo Domingo our eyes
remained fixed on the Cathedral, whose Spanish tiled roof reflected the
vermilion rays of the setting sun, and afford shelter for one of the
world&rsquo;s greatest heroes and benefactors.</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Hic locus abscondit pr&aelig;clari membra

<p class="first">And then, as the last vestiges of this noble old

<p>&ldquo;The majesty of great memories,&rdquo; he declares,
&ldquo;seems concentrated in the name of Christopher Columbus. It is
the originality of his vast conceptions, the compass and fertility of
his genius, and the courage which bore out against the long series of

<p>And we dreamed&mdash;or was it a telepathic intimation of a future
reality?&mdash;when the precious remains, that have so long been
guarded in this distant and rarely visited island, should be
transferred for a third and a last time, but this time where they might
be visited and venerated by millions instead of the few hundred that
now find their way hither, and where they might occupy a noble
sarcophagus, like that which beneath the dome of the Invalides, holds
all that is mortal of the great Corsican, and in a temple worthy alike
of the man and of the greatest nation in the world. There is one
edifice in which all the nations of the hemisphere discovered by
Columbus have a common interest, the splendid structure now being
erected in Washington, for the special use and benefit of the North and
South American Republics. Here in the capital of the nation, in the
district named after the discoverer, in sight of the tomb of the
&ldquo;Father of his Country,&rdquo; should the remains of &ldquo;The
Admiral of the Ocean Sea,&rdquo; find an abiding place of sepulture
commensurate with the magnitude of his achievements. Alongside and in
connection with this Pan-American building, in the heart of what is to
be &ldquo;the City Beautiful,&rdquo; and there alone, let there be
erected a mausoleum that, as a monument of art, shall rank, as did
those of Hadrian and Mausolus, amongst the world&rsquo;s wonders, and
be a fitting culmination of the architectural creations that have been
planned for the great and growing capital of the New World, the world
of Columbus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From Santo Domingo we went to Puerto Rico. As is well
known, this island was discovered by Columbus during his second voyage
in 1493. Sixteen years later a settlement was founded here by Ponce de
Leon. It was from here that he set forth in quest of the
&ldquo;Fountain of Youth,&rdquo; and it is in San Juan, in the Church
of Santo Domingo, that he was buried after a poisoned arrow from the
bow of an Indian brave had terminated his existence during his second
expedition to Florida. Over his tomb was inscribed the following
epitaph:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mole sub hac fortis requiescunt ossa Leonis</p>
<p class="line">Qui vicit factis nomina magna suis.&rdquo;<a class=

"xd21e1294src">34</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">After sojourning a week in Puerto Rico, we called at
the little Dutch island Cura&ccedil;ao and spent the greater part of
the day in the quaint little town of Willemstad. The harbor is
perfectly landlocked and was at one time the favorite rendezvous for
pirates and buccaneers. In strolling through its streets, we could
easily fancy ourselves in some quiet section of Rotterdam or Amsterdam.
The island is known for its much prized liqueur, Cura&ccedil;ao, which,
however, strange to say, is not made here but in Holland.
Cura&ccedil;ao supplies only the orange rind with which the liqueur is
flavored. Willemstad is a popular resort for smugglers, who do an
extensive business on the mainland, and the temporary home of a colony
of exiled Venezuelan generals and colonels, who here eke out a
precarious existence in the hope that one of their periodical
revolutions may soon give them the eagerly desired opportunity of
enjoying some of the spoils of office, that, for the time being, are
monopolized by their enemies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">ON THE SPANISH MAIN</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We arrived in the roadstead of La Guayra early in the
morning, after our departure from Cura&ccedil;ao, and our vessel was
soon moored alongside a splendid breakwater, which extends out from the
shore for more than a half mile, and gives this port a fairly good
harbor, which even the largest ships may enter. We were now on the
Spanish Main where we had our first view of the great continent of
South America.</p>
<p>As the phrase, &ldquo;The Spanish Main,&rdquo; has been given many
and different significations since it was first introduced, I shall
employ it, in what was long its generally accepted meaning, as
designating the southern part of the Caribbean Sea, and the coast line
of what, on the early maps of South America, was known as Tierra
Firme&mdash;the Firm Land&mdash;namely, that part of the present
republics of Venezuela and Colombia on which the Spaniards effected
their first settlements.</p>
<p>The first thing to attract our attention and that which impressed us
most, was the apparently stupendous height of the mountains in the rear
of the town. Before us were La Silla and Pico de Naiguata, sheer and
precipitous, rising almost from the water&rsquo;s edge and piercing the
clouds at an altitude of more than eight thousand and two hundred feet.
They are thus apparently higher than any of the peaks of the Rocky
Mountain chain. The summits of the latter are attained only after
traveling over a long and gradual incline, that is scarcely
perceptible, and after scaling numerous foothills that conceal and
dwarf the giants which tower behind and above them. Thus, while the
summit of Pike&rsquo;s Peak is more then fourteen thousand feet above
sea level, it is less than seven thousand feet above the charming town
of Manitou, that nestles at its feet. For this reason, and because the
sides of the Colorado peak are not so steep as those behind La Guayra,
La Silla and the Pico de Naiguata give an impression of height and
majesty that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>is not experienced even when contemplating the
loftiest monarchs of the Alps.</p>
<p>The distance from La Guayra to Caracas, in a straight line, is less
than six miles; by rail it is twenty-three. There has been talk of
connecting the capital and its port by a tunnel but under the existing
conditions of the country it will be a long time before such an
undertaking shall be realized.</p>
<p>From sea level to the summit of the range, the railroad is
conspicuous for its heavy grade&mdash;about four per cent.&mdash;its
sharp curves, its cuts and tunnels, but above all for the magnificent
scenery everywhere visible. From the car window one may look over
precipitous cliffs into yawning abysses far below the track on which
the train slowly and carefully winds its way. On the beetling rocks
above, in the dark and wild gorge below&mdash;what a wealth of
vegetation, what luxuriance of growth, what a gorgeous display of
vari-colored fruit and flower, of delicate fern and majestic palm!</p>
<p>As a feat of engineering the road is quite equal to any of the kind
that may be seen in Europe or the United States; but for scenic beauty
and splendor it is absolutely unrivaled. On the lofty flanks of the
Rockies, and in the deep ca&ntilde;ons of the Fraser and Colorado
rivers, where the shrill whistle of the locomotive startles the falcon
and the eagle, one can have fully gratified one&rsquo;s sense of the
grand and the sublime in nature; but here it is beauty, grandeur,
sublimity all combined. And what marvelous perspectives, what
delightful exhibitions of color, what superb and ever-changing effects
of light and shade&mdash;scenes that would be the despair of Claude
Lorrain and Salvator Rosa, and as difficult to catch on canvas as the
glories of the setting sun.</p>
<p>No where else in the wide world can one find such another picture as
greets one&rsquo;s vision when, rising into cloudland, one gets
one&rsquo;s last view of the Caribbean circling the mountain thousands
of feet beneath the silent and awe-stricken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>spectator. It is matchless, unique&mdash;like
Raphael&rsquo;s Madonna di San Xysto, impossible to duplicate.</p>
<p>As we reached this point, the sea disclosed itself as a vast mirror
resplendent under the aureate glow of the quivering beams of the
departing lord of day. Fleecy clouds of every form and hue flitting
over sea and land, by a peculiar optical illusion, magnified both
objects and distances, and unfolded before the astonished beholder a
panorama of constantly varying magnitude and of surpassing loveliness.
On the foreground Nature shed her brightest green, and imparted to
flower and foliage the flush of the rainbow. Of a truth,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Never did Ariel&rsquo;s plume</p>
<p class="line">At golden sunset hover</p>
<p class="line">O&rsquo;er scenes so full of bloom.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Away and beyond was the boundless, glimmering sea,
ravishing in its thousand tints, and in its harmonious dance of
vanishing light and color.</p>
<p>So occupied were we in observing the beauties of the everchanging
landscape, that, before we realized it, we were in Caracas. And so
momentary was the twilight&mdash; a characteristic of the
tropics&mdash;that the transition from daylight to darkness was almost
startling. We found an unexpected compensation, however, in the
friendly glow of the electric lights which illumine the street and
plazas of Venezuela&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>We spent a month in and about Caracas, finding every hour enjoyable.
It is, in many respects, a beautiful city and located near the base of
the mountains La Silla, the saddle&mdash;from its fancied resemblance
to an army saddle&mdash;and El Cerro de Avila, in a charming valley
from one to three miles wide and about ten miles long. The valley was
at one time, seemingly, the bed of a lake, and its soil is,
consequently, exceedingly fertile, and admirably adapted to cultivation
of the farm and garden produce of both tropical and temperate climates.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>A friend, who had traveled much, once told us that he regarded
Taormina, in Sicily, as the best and most beautiful winter resort in
the world. We are familiar with both places, and can say, in all
candor, that we prefer Caracas. True, Taormina is one of the beauty
spots of the world, but one expects to find more than beauty in a
winter resort. Some years before our visit to Caracas we were in
Taormina, and during the same time of the winter as marked our visit to
Caracas, and we found it so cold that, during our entire stay, we were
obliged to have our rooms heated by steam. In the latter place we could
leave the doors and windows of our room open day and night, and
enjoyed, during all the time we tarried there, the name soft, balmy,
fragrant air, and the same equable temperature. The mean temperature we
found to be about 70&deg; F., the thermometer seldom rising above
75&deg; F. and rarely falling below 65&deg; F. The only place where we
over had a like experience was on the slope of a mountain in one of the
Hawaiian Islands, where the temperature is so constant that the native
language has no word to express the idea of weather&mdash;what we call
&ldquo;weather&rdquo; being always the same.</p>
<p>Considering the many natural beauties of the valley of Caracas, its
rich, tropical vegetation, its matchless climate, its soft, balmy
atmosphere, the rippling brooks and purling rivulets that everywhere
gladden the landscape, we can understand how an early Spanish
historian, Oviedo y Ba&ntilde;os,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1343src"
href="#xd21e1343" name="xd21e1343src">35</a> was in his enthusiasm led
to declare this location of the capital of Venezuela to be that of the
home of perpetual spring&mdash;nay, more, that of a terrestrial
paradise. If he could revisit these scenes to-day, he would find but
little change in their general physical aspect, but he would see at
once that the serpent&rsquo;s trailing has cast a blight over its
former beauty, and that the people, as a whole, have sadly degenerated
since his time. Then, as he tells us, the stranger that had spent two
months in this Eden would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>never wish to leave it. Alas, that
one cannot say this now!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1350src" href=

</div>
<p>After a month&rsquo;s sojourn in Caracas we felt the <i>Spiritus
movendi</i> again upon us, urging us onward, we knew not whither. We
were under the spell of what the Germans so aptly call the
<i>Wanderlust</i> and it did not make much difference what direction we
took so long as the road we traveled enabled us to enjoy new scenes and
visit peoples whose manners and customs were different from our
own.</p>
<p>Having thoroughly rested and recuperated the strength we so much
needed, we felt that we should like to take a trip to the Orinoco, in
order that we might have an opportunity of studying the fauna and flora
of its wonderful valley and of meeting some of the many Indian tribes
that rove through its forests. In spite of all our efforts, however, we
could find no one who could give us any satisfactory information about
the best means of reaching the river or the time that would be required
to make the journey. We consulted government officials and merchants
that had business relations along the Orinoco, but their information
was vague and contradictory.</p>
<p>We purposed going first to San Fernando de Apure, on an affluent of
the Orinoco, and thence by water to Ciudad Bolivar and the
Port-of-Spain. We were told that there were steamers plying between San
Fernando and Ciudad Bolivar&mdash;the chief city on the
Orinoco&mdash;during the wet season, our summer, but not during the dry
season, our winter. That meant that if we went to San Fernando we
should be obliged to use a canoe to reach Ciudad Bolivar, and this
implied a long, tiresome, and somewhat dangerous voyage under a burning
sun and in what we were assured was a malarious region. The time
necessary to reach the river on horseback varied, according to our
informants, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>from one to two weeks. One well known general, it
was stated, had by an extraordinary <i>tour de force</i> made the trip
the preceding year in four days. Some assured us we could go by
carriage the entire distance. Others were equally positive that there
was nothing more than a trail connecting the points we wished to visit,
and that mules would be better than horses for such a journey. Outside
of one or two small towns, there were no hotels along the route. But
this did not matter. We had our camping outfit with us, and rather
preferred to live in our tent to risking our night&rsquo;s rest in such
uninviting <i>posadas</i>&mdash;lodging houses&mdash;as we should meet
with in the way.</p>
<p>Finding that we could not get in Caracas the information we desired,
we resolved to go to Victoria, an interesting town southwest of the
capital, and accessible by rail in a few hours. But our success in
Victoria was no better than it had been in Caracas. In spite of all our
efforts we could elicit no information that would warrant us in
starting on so long a journey as that to the Orinoco, and one that
might involve many hardships and dangers without adequate
compensation.</p>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding our ill success so far, we did not for a moment
think of abandoning our contemplated trip to the valley of the Orinoco.
Far from it. The more we thought of it the more fascinating the project
became. Now that we had gone so far, we were determined to see the
famous river at all hazards. If we could not reach it by one route we
would go by another. We accordingly concluded to continue our journey
by rail to Puerto Cabello, and thence go by steamer to Trinidad. Once
there, we felt reasonably sure we should find some means of attaining
our goal&mdash;the grassy plains and vast forests of the Orinoco basin.
As proved by subsequent events, it was for us a most fortunate
occurrence that we did not adhere to our original plan of reaching the
Orinoco by San Fernando de Apure, as our change of programme enabled us
to see far more of South America and under more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>favorable auspices, than we had before deemed
possible.</p>
<p>Instead of going directly to Puerto Cabello, we spent a week at the
quiet old city of Valencia, Nueva Valencia del Rey, as it was
originally called, and which, according to the Valencianos, should be
the capital of the republic. It was begun in 1555, by Alonzo Diaz
Moreno, twelve years before Santiago de Leon de Caracas&mdash;the
original name of the capital&mdash;was founded by Diego de Losada. As a
matter of fact, Valencia was designated as the capital of Venezuela at
the time of the revolt against Spain, and congress was actually in
session there at the time Caracas was destroyed by an earthquake in
1812. Five years after its foundation, Valencia was captured by the
infamous Lopez de Aguirre and his sanguinary band, who treated its
inhabitants with the greatest atrocity. Near by, on the plains of
Carabobo, was fought the decisive victory which resulted in Venezuelan
independence.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1391src" href="#xd21e1391"
name="xd21e1391src">37</a></p>
<p>As a port of entry, Puerto Cabello is incomparably superior to La
Guayra, and has one of the finest harbors on the Caribbean. The
climate, however, is far from salubrious. Situated, as it is, in low,
marshy ground, surrounded by countless pools of stagnant water, it is
not surprising to find that malarial fevers are prevalent here, and
that <i lang="es">El v&oacute;mito</i>&mdash;yellow fever&mdash;is a

<h3 class="main">THE PEARL COAST</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A most delightful voyage was ours from Puerto Cabello
to the Port-of-Spain, the capital of Trinidad. The sea was as placid as
an inland lake on a windless day, and the air as balmy as in a morning
of June. The coast of the mainland was nearly always in sight, and at
times the peaks of the Coast Range rose far above the fleecy clouds
that encircled their lofty flanks. The days were beautiful but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>the nights were glorious. All our youthful dreams
about the delights of sailing on southern seas, amid emerald isles, and
under bright starlit skies, where soft spice-scented zephyrs blow, were
here realized. The serenity and transparency of the azure vault of
heaven, with its countless shooting stars, had their counterpart in the
smooth, unruffled Caribbean, to whose water millions of Noctiluc&aelig;
imparted a phosphorescent glow which rivaled that of molten gold. We
were at last in the favored home of the chambered nautilus, happily,
dreamily gliding along on an even keel</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1118">And coral reefs lie bare,</p>
<p class="line">Where the cold sea-maids rise from crystal springs</p>
<p class="line xd21e1118">To sun their streaming hair.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Yes, we were skirting along the Pearl Coast,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1420src" href="#xd21e1420" name=
"xd21e1420src">38</a> celebrated in legend and story&mdash;darkened by
deeds of barbarous cruelty and resplendent in records of heroic
achievement. I shall not tell of our second visit to La Guayra and of
the day we spent at Macuto or describe the present conditions of the
historic old towns of Barcelona, Cumana and Carupano, which lay on our
course. Much might be said of all these places, distinguished, since
their foundation, both in peace and war.</p>
<p>I cannot, however, pass this part of the Pearl Coast without
recalling the fact that it was near Cumana that the earliest
settlements in Venezuela were effected and that here it was that one of
the first&mdash;if not the first&mdash;permanent colonies on the
mainland of the New World was established. Columbus, during his fourth
voyage, attempted to make a settlement in Veragua, that might serve as
a base of future operations, but the attempt resulted in complete
failure. Similar efforts had been made by Alonso de Ojeda and others,
but without lasting results. Panama was not founded until 1516 or 1517.
Nombre de Dios, it is true, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>was founded somewhat earlier, but in
the beginning was little more than a blockhouse. But here, as early in
1514, on the Rio Manzanares, then the River Cumana, only &ldquo;a
cross-bow-shot&rdquo; from the shore, the zealous Sons of St. Francis
had erected a monastery, and a short time subsequently the Dominicans
established another monastery, not far distant, at Santa Fe de
Chiribichi. Here they gathered the simple children of the forest around
them, and soon had the beginnings of flourishing missions.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1427src" href="#xd21e1427" name=
"xd21e1427src">39</a> The trusting and unspoiled Indians welcomed these
apostles of the gospel of peace and love, and soon learned to regard
them as friends and fathers. So peaceful did all this land become under
the influence of the benign teaching of the gentle friars, that,
according to Oviedo and Las Casas, a Christian trader could go alone
anywhere without ever being molested.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1439src" href="#xd21e1439" name="xd21e1439src">40</a></p>
<p>It was to the Pearl Coast that Las Casas came, after he found, by
sad experience, that his efforts in behalf of the Indians in Cuba,
Espa&ntilde;ola and Puerto Rico were frustrated by influences he was
unable to control. It was here, aided by Franciscans and Dominicans,
who had preceded him by only a few years, that he purposed laying the
corner stone of that vast Indian commonwealth, for which he had secured
letters patent from Charles V.</p>
<p>For this great experiment in colonization, the greatest the world
has ever known, he had received a grant of land extending from Paria to
Santa Marta, and from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Caribbean Sea to Peru. In his
colossal undertaking he planned to have the co&ouml;peration of an
order of knights&mdash;the Knights of the Golden Spur&mdash;specially
created to aid him in the work of civilizing and christianizing the
Indians. It was his dream to bring within the fold of the Church all
the Indians of Central and South America, and to establish for their
behoof and benefit an ideal Christian state such as a century and a
half later was realized in the fertile basins of the Parana and
Paraguay.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1448src" href="#xd21e1448" name=
"xd21e1448src">41</a></p>
<p>If the noble philanthropist had been properly supported by the rich
and the powerful, the entire course of subsequent events in South
America would have been altered, and the historian would have been
spared the task of penning those dark annals of injustice and iniquity
which, for long centuries, were such a foul blot on humanity. But from
the time he set foot on the Pearl Coast, in pursuance of his noble
plan, he found himself beset by untold difficulties, and his designs
thwarted at every turn, and that, too, by his own countrymen. Blinded
by lust of gold and pleasure, they left nothing undone to insure the
failure of his project, and in the end succeeded in their nefarious
purpose.</p>
<p>Abandoned by those on whose co&ouml;peration he fully relied, he
was, in its very inception, forced to relinquish his heroic enterprise,
and return to Espa&ntilde;ola. Discomfited and heartsick, but not
crushed, he sought an asylum in the monastery of Santo Domingo. There
for eight years he devoted himself to prayer and study, and, true
Christian athlete that he was, he was always preparing himself for a
final struggle in a new arena. When his enemies least expected it, he
came forth from his retirement, and, clad in the habit of a Dominican,
proclaimed himself again the champion of the downtrodden Indian. And
from that moment until the day of his death, at the advanced age of
ninety-two, whether as a simple monk or as the bishop of <span class=

behalf of the children of the forest, and against their enslavement by
cruel, soulless seekers after fortune.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>He was, if not the first, the world&rsquo;s greatest abolitionist,
and if there are still many millions of red men in the New World to-day
who have escaped the bond of servitude, it is mainly due to their
illustrious protector, Bartolom&eacute; de Las Casas.<a class="noteref"

<h3 class="main">THE PEARL ISLANDS</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Within sight of the land where Las Casas went to lay
the first foundation-stone of his ideal commonwealth is a group of
islands which had a special claim on our attention&mdash;islands which,
during four centuries, have been the scene of many a romance and have
been stained, no one can tell how often, by the blood of tragedy.</p>
<p>These islands are Coche, Cubagua and Margarita. They were discovered
by Columbus during his third voyage, and the larger of the two was
called Margarita&mdash;pearl&mdash;from the number and beauty of the
pearls found in the waters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href=
"#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>that wash its shore. Even before he
had left the Gulf of Paria, between Trinidad and the mainland, he had
observed that the aborigines of Tierra Firme were decked with bracelets
and necklaces of pearl, and soon discovered, to his great satisfaction,
that these much-prized gems could be obtained in great abundance, and
that many of them were of extraordinary size and beauty. Peter Martyr,
as translated by Eden, tells us, &ldquo;Many of these pearls were as
bygge as hasellnuttes, and oriente (as we caule it), that is lyke unto
them of the Easte partes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1487src"
href="#xd21e1487" name="xd21e1487src">45</a> During the first third of
the sixteenth century the value of the pearls sent to Europe was equal
to nearly one-half of the output of all the mines in America.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1490src" href="#xd21e1490" name=
"xd21e1490src">46</a> In one year&mdash;1587&mdash;after the pearl
fisheries of the Gulf of Panama had been discovered, nearly seven
hundred pounds weight of pearls was sent to the markets of Europe, some
of them rivaling in beauty of sheen and perfection of form the rarest
gems ever found in the waters of Persia or Ceylon. It was from these
fisheries of the New World that Philip II obtained the famous pearl,
weighing two hundred and fifty carats, of the size and shape of a
pigeon&rsquo;s egg, mentioned by the early chroniclers.</p>
<p>So great was the commercial activity among these little islands,
especially in Cubagua, that the Spaniards built a town there, which
they called New Cadiz, although the site chosen was without water, and
so sterile that the Indians had never lived on it. Toward the end of
the sixteenth century the pearl fishery in these parts diminished
rapidly, and in the early part of the century following, the industry,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>according to Laet, had died out altogether, and
the islands of Coche and Cubagua fell into oblivion. But while it
lasted, sad to say, it meant untold misery for the thousands of Indian
and Negro slaves who were forced, at the sacrifice of their health and
often of their lives, to enrich their cruel masters by work that was
almost as fatal as that in the mines of Espa&ntilde;ola.</p>
<p>For more than two hundred years the pearl fisheries in the waters
around these islands were practically abandoned. Even during the last
century comparatively little work was done to develop an industry that,
during the sixteenth century, contributed so much to the coffers of
Spain. About the year 1900, however, a French company secured a
concession from Venezuela to fish in the neighborhood of these islands.
According to agreement, it is to pay the government ten per cent.
royalty, and to employ divers and diving apparatus so as to select only
the larger oysters and avoid the destruction of those that are
immature.</p>
<p>From the estimates available, about $600,000 worth of pearls are
annually sent to the Paris market from Margarita. While a large
proportion of them are cracked and of poor color, there are,
nevertheless, many of the finest orient, and these find ready
purchasers. As for ourselves, we saw few of large size, and none of
great value. Even in Caracas, where we made diligent inquiry about
them, we did not find a single one from these waters that would attract
attention for either size or lustre.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1504src" href="#xd21e1504" name="xd21e1504src">47</a></p>
<p>The weather could not have been more delightful than it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>was
during our all too brief cruise among these islands around which at one
time, as has been truly remarked, &ldquo;all the wonder, all the pity
and all the greed of the age had concentrated itself.&rdquo; They are
now shorn of all their former glory, and there is little to indicate
their pristine importance. They are practically deserted, with the
exception of Margarita, which, on account of the arid and unproductive
soil, is but sparsely inhabited. And yet, as they lay clustered there
on the calm bosom of the Caribbean, without a ripple to disturb its
mirror-like surface, they possessed a certain undefinable beauty that
defied analysis. Besides, there was still hovering over and around them
the glamour of days long past, when they were visited for the first
time by the great Admiral of the Ocean Sea, and later on, by Cristobal
Guerra and Alonzo Ni&ntilde;o, and by Francisco Orellana, after his
memorable voyage down the Amazon.</p>
<p>The sun was sloping down to his ocean bed&mdash;the air was
glimmering with a mellow light, as we drifted from these waters over
which Merlin seemed to wave his enchanting wand. As the orb of day
touched the distant horizon, and sank into the crimson mist that
floated above the placid sea, it assumed strange oval and pear-shaped
figures that grew larger in their waning splendor. The rainbow hues
that steeped in molten lustre the receding shores seemed to float on
clouds from spirit-land.</p>
<p>A scene it was to swell the tamest bosom, a fairy realm where Fancy
would</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Bid the blue Tritons sound their twisted
shells,</p>
<p class="line xd21e1118">And call the Nereids from their pearly

</div>
<p class="first">Below us, beneath the dark depths of the crystal sea,
illumined by the lamps of the sea-nymphs, were living flower beds of
coral, the blooms and the palms of the ocean recesses, where the pearl
lies hid, and caves where the gem is sleeping, the gardens, fair and
bewildering in their richness and beauty, of Nereus and Amphitrite. It
was indeed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=

these charming verses:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="main">THE ISLAND OF THE BLESSED TRINITY</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The morning following our departure from the Pearl
Islands we were delighted to find our good ship anchored in the
beautiful Gulf of Paria. Thus, almost before we were aware of it, we
found ourselves reposing on the waters of the famed Orinoco which we
had made such futile efforts to reach from Caracas and Victoria. The
Gulf of Paria, as is known, is just north of several of the largest
estuaries of the Orinoco and the line of demarcation between the salt
water of the Atlantic and the fresh water of Venezuela&rsquo;s great
river is usually quite marked. As we entered the gulf, through the
Dragon&rsquo;s Mouth, we had the mainland on our starboard and the
island of Trinidad on our port quarter. Although the waters of the
Orinoco now enter the Atlantic through two channels&mdash;the Boca del
Draco and the Boca de la Sierpe&mdash;there is no doubt that Trinidad
was in recent geological times a part of the mainland of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>South
America and that the Orinoco, instead of reaching the ocean, as it now
does, flowed almost directly across the island through a depression
which is still quite conspicuous. It will thus be seen that during long
geologic ages there has been an intimate physical connection between
Trinidad and the Orinoco as there has been a close commercial
connection between the two ever since the Spanish conquest.</p>
<p>Owing to the shallow waters of the harbor of the Port-of-Spain, the
capital of Trinidad, our steamer had to anchor about a mile from the
quay. When we were prepared to go ashore&mdash;and we lost no time in
getting ready&mdash;we were surrounded by a motley crowd of sable,
shouting, importunate boatmen, all clamoring and gesticulating and
sounding the praises of their canoes, and calling attention to their
fantastic names, as if this were a guarantee of their safety and
comfort. In a few moments we were seated in one of these gayly decked
craft, with our baggage beside us, on our way to the customhouse. Here
we were delayed only a few minutes, for the English in their colonies,
as in the mother country, rarely subject the traveler to those delays
and annoyances that constitute so disagreeable a feature in certain
other countries. &ldquo;What a contrast,&rdquo; we said to ourselves,
&ldquo;between the conduct of the officials here and that of the
officious inquisitors at La Guayra!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After we had been comfortably located in our hotel&mdash;there are
several good hotels in the city&mdash;our first thought was about our
journey up the Orinoco. To our great delight we learned that there
would be a steamer going to Ciudad Bolivar in about a week. This
accorded with our plans perfectly, as we thus had ample time to visit
the chief points of interest&mdash;and there are many&mdash;of the
island, and enjoy at least a passing view of the wonderful and varied
floral display for which Trinidad is so famous.</p>
<p>Trinidad, as the reader will recollect, was discovered by Columbus
during his third voyage, and given the name it still bears in honor of
the Blessed Trinity. In his letter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56"
href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>to Ferdinand and Isabella,
describing this voyage, he says he started from San Lucar in the name
of the most Holy Trinity, and after two months at sea, during a portion
of which time all aboard suffered intensely from the heat,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1606src" href="#xd21e1606" name="xd21e1606src">2</a>
they saw to the westward three mountain peaks, united at the base,
rising up before them. Here, then, was to them the symbol of the Triune
God&mdash;the Three in One&mdash;in whose name all had left their
native land, and what more natural than that it should be named
Trinidad&mdash;the Trinity? &ldquo;Upon this,&rdquo; writes the pious
admiral, &ldquo;we repeated the &lsquo;Salve Regina,&rsquo; and other
prayers, and all of us gave thanks to our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a grateful change it was from the extreme heat which they had
endured, to the delightful climate of the newly discovered island.
&ldquo;When I reached the island of Trinidad,&rdquo; I again quote from
the Admiral&rsquo;s letter, &ldquo;I found the temperature exceedingly
mild; the fields and the foliage were remarkably fresh and green, and
as beautiful as the gardens of Valencia in April.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1617src" href="#xd21e1617" name=
"xd21e1617src">3</a></p>
<p>What so deeply impressed Columbus on his arrival at Trinidad was
what likewise most impresses the visitor to-day&mdash;its mild climate
and the beauty and luxuriance of its vegetation. Although the island is
but little more than 10&deg; from the Equator the mean annual
temperature is not more than 77&deg; F. In the mornings and evenings of
the cooler season the thermometer is about 10&deg; lower. During our
sojourn of some weeks in Trinidad we never suffered from the heat. On
the contrary, during our morning and evening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>drives,
especially in the mountains, we found the ocean breeze delightfully
refreshing.</p>
<p>Columbus was also much impressed by the natives of the island. They
had a whiter skin&mdash;he had expected to find them very
black&mdash;than any he had hitherto seen in the Indies and were very
graceful in form, tall and elegant in their movements.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few scattered families, of more or less
mixed descent, the visitor will find no evidence of the former
existence here of that splendid type of Indian of whom the great
navigator speaks so highly, and of whose race there were then on the
island many thousands of souls. Here, as on the other islands of the
West Indies, the aborigines have disappeared, never to return.</p>
<p>In their place we find the most cosmopolitan agglomeration of people
under the sun&mdash;English, Germans, Spaniards, French, Chinese,
Hindoos, and Negroes from the darkest Senegambian to the fairest
Octaroon. About one-half of the population is composed of Negroes,
one-third of Coolies, and one-sixth of whites of various nationalities
and shades of color. As we contemplated the motley crowds which always
throng the streets of the Port-of-Spain we could not but recall Lopez
de Gomara&rsquo;s curious reflections on the divers colors of the
different races of men. We give his remarks in Richard Eden&rsquo;s
translation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the marueylous thynges that god ... vseth in the
composition of man, is coloure; whiche doubtlesse can not bee
consydered withowte great admiration in beholding one to be white and
an other blacke, beinge coloures vtterlye contrary. Sum lykewyse to be
yelowe whiche is betwene blacke and white; and other of other colours
as it were of dyuers liueres. And as these colours are to be marueyled
at, euen so is it to be considered howe they dyffer one from an other
as it were by degrees, forasmuche as sum men are whyte after dyuers
sortes of whytnesse: yelowe after dyuers maners of yelowe: blacke after
dyuers sortes of blacknesse: and howe from whyte they go to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>yelowe by ... discolourygne to browne and redde:
and to blacke by asshe colour, and murrey sumwhat lyghter then blacke:
and tawnye lyke vnto the west Indian which are all togyther in general
eyther purple, or tawny lyke vnto sodde quynses, or of the colour of
chestnuttes or olyues: which colour is to them natural and not by theyr
goynge naked as many haue thought: albeit theyr nakednesse haue sumwhat
helped thereunto. Therfore in lyke maner and with suche diuersitie as
men are commonly whyte in Europe and blacke in Affrike, euen with like
varietie are they tawny in these Indies, with diuers degrees diuersly
inclynynge more or lesse to blacke or whyte.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1634src" href="#xd21e1634" name="xd21e1634src">4</a></p>
<p>The Coolies interested us immensely, in whatever part of the island
we met them&mdash;and they are to be seen everywhere&mdash;and were for
us the subject-matter of constant study. They occupy an entire suburb
of the Port-of-Spain, and, for those who are interested in sociological
and economic questions, no place is more worthy of a visit. Day after
day, when the delicious evening breezes began to sweep in from the
ocean, we found ourselves directing our course towards the
&ldquo;Indian Quarter,&rdquo; as it is called, and we always found
something new to arrest our attention or excite our admiration. It
required no effort whatever of the imagination to fancy ourselves in
the crowded streets and markets of Benares or Madras.</p>
<p>Port-of-Spain, whose population is about 50,000, rejoices in quite a
number of large and handsome public buildings and churches. Among the
latter the Roman Catholic Cathedral is conspicuous. The homes of the
people in the better quarters of the city&mdash;surrounded by a rich
profusion of tropical flowers, and shrubs and trees covered with
blooming climbers&mdash;are frequently models of architectural
excellence, and betoken refinement, comfort and even affluence.</p>
<p>To us the most attractive part of the city was the Botanical Garden,
adjoining the residence of the governor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>This spot is justly
famous not only in the West Indies, but the world over. Here have been
collected from every tropical clime all the plants and shrubs and trees
that are admired, for beauty of bloom, richness of fragrance, or grace
and majesty of form.</p>
<p>Here we see the hibiscus shrub, with large, flaming, crimson
flowers; the poinciana, aglow with a bloom of yellow and orange,
scarlet flowered balisiers, and the poui tree decked with a rich robe
of saffron. Alongside them are oranges and lemons, pineapples, guavas,
mongosteens, nutmegs, tamarinds, and scores of other kinds of tropical
fruits. A little further on we meet with tea shrubs, the clove and the
cinnamon tree, the rubber tree, and the <i>Bertolettia excelsa</i>,
laden with nuts, each of which contains from ten to twenty seeds. Then
there are the curious cannon-ball tree, stately samans, the leopardwood
tree, the trumpet tree and others equally attractive. Besides all these
there are those princes of the forest&mdash;the palms&mdash;from every
quarter of the tropics, with every variety of trunk and
leaf&mdash;date, fern, talipot, Palmyra, and groo-groo palms, the tall
traveler&rsquo;s-tree with its graceful plantain-like leaves, and the
<i>Oreodoxa speciosa</i>, &ldquo;the glory of the mountains.&rdquo; On
and among them are rare orchids, and parasites of countless species,
climbing ferns, and convolvuluses of every hue.</p>
<p>And to complete this scene of beauty, we behold at almost every
step, fluttering across our path, brilliant heliconias and other
butterflies that contribute such life and charm to the forest glories
of tropical lands. And then the humming birds&mdash;those lovely
animated gems that flit from bush to bush, and flower to
flower&mdash;flashing all the fire of the opal, and emitting in rapid
succession all the brilliant hues of the topaz and the sapphire, the
ruby and the emerald. They are not as numerous now&mdash;more is the
pity&mdash;as they were formerly, when the aborigines gave the name
Iere&mdash;humming bird&mdash;to this island on account of their great
numbers and when they protected and venerated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>them as
the souls of departed Indians. But one still meets them in one&rsquo;s
strolls through the gardens and the forest, and always with a new sense
of wonder and delight.</p>
<p>Here, of a truth, were realized, nay, eclipsed, all the marvels of
the garden of Alcinous, for here</p>

<p class="first">It is, indeed, worth a visit from afar to see and
study these marvels of plant and vine, and bush and tree of the Botanic
Garden. But the whole island is, at least for the stranger from the
North, one vast botanic garden. Go where we will, we are astonished and
bewildered by the novelty and the exuberance of the vegetation that
surrounds us.</p>
<p>If we drive over the broad and well-kept roads along the western
coast, we pass under shady avenues of cocoa palms bending under their
burden of fruit. If we go to the cacao groves&mdash;and they are large
and numerous here&mdash;our eyes are gladdened by the vermilion bloom
that covers the protecting <i>Erythrina umbrosa</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1689src" href="#xd21e1689" name="xd21e1689src">6</a> In a glen
hard by is a giant ceiba, transformed, by the countless number of
creepers and epiphytes to which it has given hospitality, into a vast
air-garden. Along the streams and mountain torrents are lovely canopies
formed by the plume-like foliage of bamboos&mdash;seventy to eighty
feet high&mdash;affording retreats of rarest sylvan beauty. Again it is
in the <i lang="es">Rosa del Monte</i>, with its crimson bloom, the
purple dracona, the yellow croton, the night-blooming cereus, the
angelim, covered with purple tassels, the carmine poinsettia, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>sweet-scented vanilla, festoons of purple flowered
lianas, and gray candelabra of a giant cereus. Beyond it all, as a
felicitous background to this gorgeous display and at the same time an
adequate enclosure for Flora&rsquo;s fairy palace, there is such a
profusion of vegetable tracery and arabesques &ldquo;as would have
stricken dumb with awe and delight him who ornamented the Loggie of the
Vatican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further on we have the comely bread-fruit tree, with its
deeply-lobed leaves and its massive fruit, the many-rooted and
many-branched mangrove,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1705src" href=
"#xd21e1705" name="xd21e1705src">7</a> and not far distant is a clump
of royal palms, with their smooth pearl-gray columns and coronals of
verdure. Or there is a group of kindred growth&mdash;jagua
palms&mdash;whose crown of pinnated leaves, each full twenty-five feet
long, caused Humboldt to declare that on this truly magnificent tree
&ldquo;Nature had lavished every beauty of form.&rdquo; While standing
by one of the pillar-stems of the jagua palm, beneath its emerald
ostrich plumes, we were quite prepared to share Kingsley&rsquo;s
enthusiasm for palm trees in general. &ldquo;Like a Greek statue in a
luxurious drawing-room,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;sharp-cut, cold,
virginal; shaming by the grandeur of mere form the voluptuousness of
mere color, however rich and harmonious; so stands the palm of the
forest; to be worshipped rather than to be loved.&rdquo;<a class=

<p>It would tire the reader to attempt a description of the many
pictures of interest of this charming island, of its delightful drives
in every direction, of its beauteous cascades and waterfalls, one of
which, Maracas Falls, three hundred feet in height, is a reproduction
of Bridal Falls in the Yosemite, with the added setting of tropical
verdure. No pen can picture the exquisite charm of the Caura or Maraval
valleys, of Blue Basin and Macaripe Bay, or of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>the Five
Islands&mdash;real gems of the ocean&mdash;with their cozy and inviting
cottages. When in Egypt years ago we fancied that we should like to
spend the rest of our days on the island of Phil&aelig;, ever in the
presence of its matchless ruins. When we spent a happy day&mdash;how
fleeting it was&mdash;on one of these five islands&mdash;it was the
largest and fairest&mdash;we felt that we had at length found that
inland home&mdash;far away from noise and strife, from</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fever and fret and aimless stir&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">of which we had so often dreamed, and in which we had
so often longed to dwell.</p>
<p>The people of Trinidad think their island the most beautiful of all
the West Indian group. Having visited, at one time or other, all the
chief islands comprising the Greater and Lesser Antilles, we should
hesitate to dispute their claim. It is certainly very beautiful, and
possesses many attractions that are either entirely absent from the
other islands or are found only in a lesser degree. Puerto Rico and
Jamaica equal it in many respects, and in others surpass it, but in
some important features the American possession is inferior to those of
the British.</p>
<p>I have said nothing of La Brea, the wonderful pitch lake for which
Trinidad has been celebrated since the time of Raleigh,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1730src" href="#xd21e1730" name="xd21e1730src">9</a>
and which for some decades past has supplied us with much of the
asphalt used in the United States. This curious phenomenon has been
described so often that there is no call for further comment. Suffice
to say that it, together with the sugar plantations and the cacao
groves, constitutes the chief source of the revenue of the island.</p>
<p>Like Cura&ccedil;ao, Trinidad is a favorite resort of Venezuelan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>revolutionists, expatriated generals and colonels
and their sympathizers. As a rule, they are an impecunious set, and
rarely interesting. Crespo and Guzman Blanco both started from here on
their way to the presidential chair in Caracas. So did the unfortunate
Paredes, shortly before our arrival in Venezuela, but he had scarcely
set foot on the soil of his native country, which he had promised to
liberate from the evils of Castroism, before he, with his followers,
was shot down in cold blood.</p>
<p>On account of its proximity to the mainland and commanding, as it
does, the entire Orinoco basin, Trinidad should enjoy an extensive
trade with Venezuela. And this she would undoubtedly have were it not
that Venezuela imposes an extra <i lang="la">ad valorem</i> duty of
thirty per cent. on all merchandise that comes from or by way of
Trinidad. This is in retaliation for the island&rsquo;s harboring
smugglers and revolutionists. One of the results of this policy is
smuggling on a most extensive scale, at which many of the customs
officials connive. This means a great loss to the Venezuelan
government, for it is estimated that it thus loses a greater part of
the duties that should go to the national treasury.</p>
<p>Another temptation to smuggle arises from the excessively high
tariff on certain necessary articles of consumption. Thus salt, which
is a government monopoly, costs sixteen times as much in Ciudad Bolivar
as it does in Trinidad. The natural consequence is that there is a
large contraband traffic in this important commodity. In some cases the
smugglers elude the vigilance of the government officials and pay
nothing whatever in the way of duties. In others they have an
understanding with the officials, and pay <i lang="es">por
composicion</i>&mdash;that is, only a portion of the tax&mdash;the
other portion being divided between the official and the smuggler.</p>
<p>Contraband trade, however, is nothing new in this part of the world.
It dates back to the sixteenth century when, according to Fray Padre
Simon, the learned author of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span><i lang="es">Noticias Historiales de
las Conquistas de Tierra Firme</i>, religion and policy prohibited all
commercial relations between Spaniards and foreigners, especially the
Dutch and the English.</p>
<p>As an <i>obiter dictum</i>, however, it may be remarked that it was
this restricted and short-sighted trade policy that, more than anything
else, led to the enormous losses that Spain suffered during so many
decades from corsairs and buccaneers, and that eventually resulted in
the wars of independence in the Spanish colonies of the New World.</p>

<h3 class="main">THE DELTA OF THE ORINOCO</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We were still reveling in the countless beauties of
forest and field&mdash;quite oblivious of the passage of
time&mdash;when we were informed that our steamer would, in a few
hours, start for Ciudad Bolivar, the chief city on the Orinoco, and
distant about two days&rsquo; sail from the Port-of-Spain.</p>
<p>Eager as we were to explore the wonders of the famed and mysterious
Orinoco, it was with great reluctance that we tore ourselves away from
the cherished home of flowers and humming birds&mdash;sweet Iere. In
Trinidad, thanks to the kind and considerate hospitality of its people,
we had enjoyed all the comforts of home and the same freedom of
movement as if we had been given the keys of the city.</p>
<p>Our steamer was scheduled to leave at two o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, but, as a matter of fact, did not weigh anchor until some
hours later. This, however, we did not regret, as it gave us an
opportunity to have &ldquo;one last lingering look&rdquo; at the island
beautiful from the upper deck of the vessel. Besides this, we could by
means of our field glasses take a survey of the Gulf of Paria&mdash;for
it is famous in history, this Gulf of Paria&mdash;and has been visited
by men whose names are writ large in the annals of the world&rsquo;s
heroes.</p>
<p>Its waters were visited in 1805 by England&rsquo;s one-eyed,
one-armed sailor-man, while in pursuit of the French and Spanish
warships which he had chased from Gibraltar to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>Caribbean Sea and thence back to Trafalgar, where
Spain lost its navy and England her greatest admiral. &ldquo;Had Nelson
found the hostile squadron under the lee of Trinidad, the delta of the
Orinoco would now be as famous in naval history as the delta of the
Nile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is, however, the imposing figure of Spain&rsquo;s great admiral,
Cristobal Colon, that looms highest in these parts. He it was that gave
the chief promontories of island and mainland, and the channels that
separate the one from the other, many of the names they still bear.</p>
<p>Far down to the south is <i>La Boca de la Sierpe</i>&mdash;the
Serpent&rsquo;s Mouth&mdash;the channel that separates the
southwesternmost point of Trinidad from Venezuela. It was through this
channel that Columbus passed when he entered the gulf in which we now
are, and from which he got his first view of the mainland of the New
World. But he did not realize at first the magnitude of his discovery.
Thinking the land he saw on his port quarter was an island&mdash;for
during his two preceding voyages he had seen nothing but islands,
outside of Cuba, which he fancied to be the eastern part of
Asia&mdash;he named it Isla Santa, or Holy Island. A short distance to
the northwest of us is <i>La Boca del Draco</i>, the Dragon&rsquo;s
Mouth, through which the great navigator</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Push&rsquo;d his prows into the setting sun,</p>
<p class="line">And made West East.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The names Serpent&rsquo;s Mouth and Dragon&rsquo;s
Mouth were given to the two straits mentioned on account of the strong
currents found there and on account of the danger Columbus experienced
in taking his ships through them. His letter to Ferdinand and Isabella
contains a graphic description of the dangers he encountered while
passing through the Serpent&rsquo;s Mouth. &ldquo;In the dead of
night,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;while I was on deck, I heard an awful
roaring, that came from the south, toward the ship; on the top of this
rolling sea came a mighty wave roaring with a frightful noise, and with
all this terrific uproar were other conflicting currents, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>producing, as I have already said, a sound as of
breakers upon rocks. To this day I have a vivid recollection of the
dread I then felt lest the ship might flounder under the force of that
tremendous sea; but it passed by, and reached the mouth of the
before-mentioned passage, where the uproar lasted for a considerable
time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1793src" href="#xd21e1793"
name="xd21e1793src">10</a> He had similar difficulty in making his exit
through the Dragon&rsquo;s Mouth.</p>
<p>No wonder that the frightened sailors of Columbus imagined that they
were the sport of the Evil One. &ldquo;Being in the region of
Paria,&rdquo; writes Navarrete, &ldquo;the Admiral asked the pilots
what they made their position to be; some said that they were in the
sea of Spain, others that they were in the sea of Scotland, and that
all the seamen were in despair, and said the Devil had brought them
there.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1800src" href="#xd21e1800"
name="xd21e1800src">11</a></p>
<p>Columbus, as has been stated, at first considered the land on his
port side to be insular in character, but before he left the Gulf of
Paria he was evidently convinced by the raging surges of fresh water
that had nearly swamped his ships, that he had discovered a land of
continental dimensions. In his letter to the Spanish sovereigns he
writes, &ldquo;This land, which your highnesses have sent me to
explore, is very extensive, and I think there are many other countries
in the south of which the world has never had any knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had observed that a very large river debouched from the land of
Gracia and he at once &ldquo;rightly conjectured that the currents and
the overwhelming mountains of water which rushed into these straits
with such an awful roaring, arose from the contest between the fresh
water and the sea. The fresh water struggled with the salt to oppose
its entrance and the salt water contended against the fresh in its
efforts to gain a passage outward. And I formed the conjecture, that at
one time there was a continuous neck of land from the island of
Trinidad and the land of Gracia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"
href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>where the two straits now
are.&rdquo; All these conclusions have been confirmed by the
observations of subsequent explorers.</p>
<p>What, however, will most interest the curious reader are the
speculations into which Columbus was led by the various phenomena
observed in the Gulf of Paria. The most fantastic, from our modern
point of view, were his theories regarding the form of the earth and
the location of the Terrestrial Paradise.</p>
<p>Before his arrival in the Gulf of Paria, he had been a firm believer
in the sphericity of the earth, but in this part of the world he had
observed so many new and unexpected features&mdash;&ldquo;so much
irregularity,&rdquo; as he phrased it&mdash;that he came &ldquo;to
another conclusion respecting the shape of the earth, namely: that it
is not round, as they describe, but of the form of a pear, which is
very round except where the stalk grows, at which part it is most
prominent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very easy for us, in the light of all the advance in
scientific knowledge since his time, to smile at his hypotheses, and
the reasonings by which he arrived at his conclusions. What seemed
plausible then appears preposterous now. But we must remember that the
proofs of the rotundity of the earth before his time were quite
empirical, and were far from having the demonstrative force of those
that are now adduced. All the epoch-making work in physics and
astronomy by such men as Galileo and Kepler, Newton and Laplace,
Huyghens and Foucault, and the French academicians, bearing on the form
of our globe, has been accomplished since his time. If we now know that
the earth has the form of an oblate <span class="corr" id="xd21e1818"
title="Source: spheriod">spheroid</span> and not that of a pear, it is
in consequence of the progress of physical astronomy during the four
centuries that have elapsed since Columbus sailed the western seas.</p>
<p>Before his time the learned had located the earthly paradise in
various parts of the eastern hemisphere. Some contended that it was in
Mesopotamia, others that it was in Ethiopia near the head waters of the
Nile, but all agreed that it was somewhere in the East. Now Columbus,
who imagined <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>he had reached the eastern part of Asia, by
sailing westwards from Spain, thought he had incontrovertible evidence
for locating the Garden of Eden in the newly discovered land of
Gracia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not suppose,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that the Earthly
Paradise is in the form of a rugged mountain, as the descriptions of it
have made it appear, but that it in on the summit of the spot which I
have described as being in the form of the stalk of a pear; the
approach of it from a distance must be by a constant and gradual
ascent; but I believe that, as I have already said, no one could ever
reach the top&rdquo;&mdash;except &ldquo;by God&rsquo;s
permission,&rdquo; as he asserts elsewhere. &ldquo;I think also that
the water I have described may proceed from it, though it be far off,
and that, stopping at the place which I have just left, it forms this
lake. There are great indications of this being the Terrestrial
Paradise, for its site coincides with the opinions of the holy and wise
theologians whom I have mentioned; and moreover, the other evidences
agree with the supposition, for I have never either read or heard of
fresh water coming in so large a quantity, in closer conjunction with
the sea. The idea is also corroborated by the blandness of the
temperature, and if the water of which I speak does not proceed from
the Earthly Paradise, it appears to be still more marvelous, for I do
not believe there is any river in the world so large or so
deep.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1827src" href="#xd21e1827"
name="xd21e1827src">12</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides Nelson and Columbus, a third celebrated seaman visited this
part of the world. This was Sir Walter Raleigh, of whom we shall have
more to say as we proceed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1845src" href=
"#xd21e1845" name="xd21e1845src">13</a></p>
<p>Our parting view of the forest-clad mountains of Trinidad we shall
never forget. The sun was setting on the mainland&mdash;the land of
Gracia of Columbus&mdash;but before disappearing below the horizon he
tinged Iere&rsquo;s mountains with a parting smile and enveloped them
in a</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&mdash;soft and purple mist</p>
<p class="line">Like a vaporous amethyst;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">reminding one of the azure haze that veils Hymettus as
the sun sinks behind Parnassus in an evening in June&mdash;something
that only the gifted Greek poet has ever been able adequately to
describe.</p>
<p>The shades of night had fallen long before we reached the
Serpent&rsquo;s Mouth, which we were obliged to pass before entering
the Macareo, one of the numerous channels of the Orinoco delta. We were
thus deprived of the opportunity of getting a good view of the huge
billows that are produced by the meeting of river and sea, of which
Columbus has given us so graphic a description.</p>
<p>Those of the passengers that were disposed to become seasick retired
to their staterooms before we arrived at the Macareo bar, where the sea
is roughest, and where the ground-swells are most unpleasant. For half
an hour or more the steamer tossed considerably, reminding one of the
English Channel in stormy weather. But the impact of surge against
surge, of which Columbus speaks, was much less than we had been led to
anticipate, and there was little indication of the forcible eddies of
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>&ldquo;violentlie swift Orinoco,&rdquo; which
caused Raleigh so much embarrassment.</p>
<p>This was easily accounted for, as the rainy season had not yet set
in, and the waters at the various estuaries were, therefore,
comparatively little agitated. Columbus, however, arrived here towards
the end of the rainy season, when the floods of the Orinoco were at
their height, while Raleigh came after the rainy season was quite well
advanced. Again, ours was a fairly good-sized steamer and better
adapted to stem wave and current than were the fragile barks of
Columbus, or the frail wherries and cock-boats of Raleigh. When the
floods of the Orinoco were at high-water mark, we can well understand
that the early navigators had reason to be deeply impressed by the
dangers that confronted them in these seething and roaring waters, and
that, to their exalted imaginations, the realities of their
surroundings were in nowise short of the fancies of the poet as
indicated in the verses at the head of this chapter. Indeed, so great
were the supposed difficulties, and so dangerous the climate in these
parts, that sailors were wont to say,</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Quien se va al Orinoco,</p>
<p class="line">Si no se muere, se vuelve loco.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1874src" href="#xd21e1874" name=
"xd21e1874src">14</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">When it comes to navigating the less known rivers and
ca&ntilde;os&mdash;channels&mdash;which, like a network, intersect the
delta in every direction, the difficulty and danger are even now so
great that the most skilled Indian pilots often become bewildered. When
this occurs nothing remains but to follow the current until one reaches
the gulf, and then enter a branch with which one is familiar. Sir
Walter gives such a graphic account of the difficulties he experienced
in reaching &ldquo;the great riuer Orenoque,&rdquo; that I reproduce in
his own words a part of a paragraph bearing on the subject.</p>
<p>After telling us how his Indian pilot had gotten lost in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>maze of ca&ntilde;os through which he was trying
to grope his way, he says: &ldquo;If God had not sent vs another helpe
we might haue wandred a whole yeere in that laborinth of riuers, ere we
had found any way, either out or in, especiallie after we were past the
ebbing and flowing, which was in fower daies: for I know all the earth
doth not yeeld the like confluence of streames and branches, the one
crossing the other as many times, and all as faire and large and so
like one to another, as no man can tell which to take: and if we went
by the Sun or compasse hoping thereby to go directly one way or other,
yet that waie we were also carried in a circle amongst multitudes of
Islands, and euery Island so bordered with high trees as no man could
see any further than the bredth of the riuer, or length of the
breach.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1883src" href="#xd21e1883"
name="xd21e1883src">15</a></p>
<p>Exaggerated as this account seems, it does scant justice to the
reality. Raleigh had no opportunity to explore the delta, and to
acquire definite notions of its immensity, or he would have had much
more to add to the foregoing description of its extent and marvels.
Even to-day we have no map of this region, which is, in many respects,
as unknown as the least explored part of Central Africa. As yet our
knowledge of land and river is limited only to its most salient
features, but this is quite sufficient to excite our wonder. Suffice it
to say that the area of the delta is greater than that of Sicily; that
its base, from its main branch at the Boca de Navios to the embouchure
of the Manamo, is nearly two hundred miles in length; that the Orinoco,
at the bifurcation of its two principal branches, is twelves miles in
width; that there are no fewer than fifty branches conveying the waters
of the mighty river into the Atlantic; that the lowlands of the delta
are divided into thousands of islands, and islets, by a network of
rivers diverging in fan-shape towards the sea, and by innumerable
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>ca&ntilde;os and bayous, some with stagnant water,
others with strong currents, ramifying in every direction in straight
lines and in curves, so that escape from their intricacies by any one,
except an experienced pilot, would be as impossible as would have been
an exit from the Cretan labyrinth without the clew of Ariadne.</p>
<p>When we arose the morning after leaving Trinidad, our steamer had
already advanced quite a distance on its way through the Macareo. This
<i>brazo</i>, or branch, is chosen not because it is the largest or the
deepest, but because it affords the shortest and most direct route
between the Port-of-Spain and Ciudad Bolivar. Although the distance to
this latter place from the mouth of the Macareo is only two hundred and
sixty miles, it usually required nearly two days, counting the stops on
the way, for the trip up the river, so strong is the current The return
trip, however, can be made in much less time.</p>
<p>We shall never forget our first view of the Orinoco and of the
impressions we then received. Was it that we were at last sailing in
the placid waters of the one river of all the world that we had from
our youth most yearned to behold, or was it that we had been dreaming
of the site and beauties of the Terrestrial Paradise, as fancied by
Columbus to exist in these parts, or was it because of both these
elements combined? We know not, but one thing is certain, and that is
that our first view of the Orinoco and its forest-shaded banks,
festooned with vines and flowers, recalled at once those musical words
of Dante,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was
spread</p>
<p class="line">O&rsquo;er the serene aspect of the pure air,</p>
<p class="line">High up as the first circle, to mine eyes</p>
<p class="line">Unwonted joy renewed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">and brought vividly back to memory his inimitable
description of his entrance into the Garden of Eden, where he was to
meet again his long-lost Beatrice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"

<p>To emphasize the illusion, there suddenly appeared under a noble
moriche palm on the flower-enameled bank of the river and only a few
rods from where we were standing, two children of the forest&mdash;a
young man and a young woman&mdash;bride and groom, we loved to
think&mdash;who were as Columbus found the American, as Adam and Eve
were after the fall, when, in the words of Milton,</p>

<p class="first">Handsome was the youth and beautiful was the maiden,
strong as Hiawatha, fair as Minnehaha&mdash;both fit models for
sculptor and painter, and such as the poet dreams of when depicting his
heroes and heroines of the forest primeval.</p>
<p>Were they the king and queen of their tribe? Fancy said,
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; But whether they were or not, one could say with
truth that the tan-colored maid was like the one Raleigh met along this
very same river and who, in his own words, &ldquo;was as well fauored
and as well shaped as euer I saw anie in England.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1932src" href="#xd21e1932" name=
"xd21e1932src">17</a></p>
<p>Near this interesting young couple, both in the heyday of youth, lay
a cluster of plantains, which was doubtless to contribute to their
morning repast. But what a coincidence that, even in this trifling
circumstance, we should find an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74"
href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>additional reminder of the
Earthly Paradise! Have not men of science named the plantain <i>Musa

that it was the plantain, and not the apple, that was the forbidden
fruit in Eden?<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1948src" href="#xd21e1948"
name="xd21e1948src">18</a> It was there to fill out the picture as an
artist in the tropics would wish to see it painted.</p>
<p>But there was still something wanting. While we were yet under the
spell of our environment, and lost in the contemplation of the Edenic
beauties around us, we were awakened from our reverie by a plunge and a
splash before the prow of our vessel&mdash;and there, greatest surprise
of all in our series of coincidences, was a giant anaconda, full thirty
feet long, vigorously plowing its way to the opposite bank of the
river. It was like the water-snakes in <i>The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner</i>.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Blue, glossy, green and velvet black,</p>
<p class="line">It coiled and swam,</p>
<p class="line">And when it reared, the elfish light</p>
<p class="line">Fell off in hoary flakes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So startling was this strange apparition that we could
scarcely credit our senses, and, had it not been for exclamations of
surprise by several of the passengers near by, we should have thought,
for a while, that it was all a dream.</p>
<p>The picture was now complete. There was the serpent in this paradise
of delights, as in the paradise of our first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>parents.
And what added to the strangeness&mdash;the uncanniness&mdash;of the
appearance of the serpent at this particular juncture was the
extraordinary rarity of such an occurrence. One of the officers of the
steamer told us that he had been sailing up and down the Orinoco for
twenty years and had never seen one of these boas before. And more
wonderful still, it was the first and last we ourselves saw, although
we subsequently traveled many thousands of miles on tropical rivers
along which such serpents have their habitat.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>All in all, our first view of the Orinoco fully met our fondest
expectations so far as they related to variety and exuberance of
vegetation and beauty of scenery. The entire delta of the Orinoco may
aptly be described as one of Nature&rsquo;s choicest conservatories, in
which Flora has collected together the fairest growths of garden and
forest, and where the charm of foliage and flower is enhanced by the
presence of countless species of the feathered tribe of richest plumage
and of dazzling hue.</p>
<p>A distinguished German traveler, Friedrich <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2005" title="Source: Gerst&auml;cher">Gerst&auml;cker</span>,
writing of his impressions of the delta of the Orinoco, does not
hesitate to declare that &ldquo;there is not in the world anything more
glorious in vegetation than is to be seen on the banks of the
Orinoco,&rdquo; and that there is no place more attractive to the
tourist.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2008src" href="#xd21e2008" name=
"xd21e2008src">20</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>To form some conception of the wonderful variety of vegetable life
to be seen in the delta, it will suffice to observe that a third of a
century ago botanists had counted in the forests of Guiana no fewer
than 132 families of plants, 772 genera and 2,450 distinct species. Of
the genera more than sixty were indigenous.</p>
<p>Although we saw many things in the delta of the Orinoco that
possessed intense interest for us, we saw none of the natives living in
houses built on the summits of trees, about which some recent writers,
following Raleigh, Humboldt and others, still entertain their readers.
To tell the truth, we did not expect to find such dwellings, as it has
been demonstrated beyond question that they do not now exist, and
probably never did exist in these parts outside of the fertile
imaginations of Raleigh and Gumilla. Humboldt never visited the delta,
and hence, what he says on the subject in <i>Personal Narrative of
Travels to the Equinoctial Regions</i>, is based on reports received
from others.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2030src" href="#xd21e2030"
name="xd21e2030src">21</a></p>
<p>Cardinal Bembo, writing in the first half of the sixteenth century,
speaks of them, and Benzoni, his contemporary, who spent fifteen years
in traveling in the New World, illustrates by an engraving what he has
to say about the Indian houses built on the tops of trees.<a class=

<p>Ferdinand Columbus, who, although a mere youth, had accompanied his
father on his fourth voyage, writes, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>when in the Gulf of
Uraba, &ldquo;We saw people living like birds in the tops of trees,
laying sticks across from bough to bough, and building their huts upon
them; and though we knew not the reason of the custom, we guessed that
it was done for fear of their enemies, or of the griffins that are in
this island.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2052src" href=
"#xd21e2052" name="xd21e2052src">23</a></p>
<p>Peter Martyr, who most likely got his information about these
strange dwellings from Ferdinand Columbus, tells us that the trees on
which they were built were of &ldquo;suche heighth, that the strength
of no mane&rsquo;s arme is able to hurle a stone to the houses buylded
therein.&rdquo; He adds, however, that the owners of the houses have
&ldquo;theyr wyne cellers in the grounde and well replenysshed.&rdquo;
And he vouchsafes the reason for not keeping the wine, with &ldquo;all
other necessayre thinges they haue, with theym in the trees. For albeit
that the vehemencie of the wynde, is not of poure to caste downe those
houses, or to breeke the branches of the trees, yet are they tossed
therwith, and swaye sumwhat from syde to syde, by reason therof, the
wyne shulde be muche troubeled with moouinge.... When the Kynge or any
of the other noblemen, dyne or suppe in these trees, theyr wynes are
brought theym from the celleres by theyr seruantes, whyche by meanes of
exercise are accustomed with noo lesse celeritie to runne vppe and
downe the steares adherete to the tree, then doo owre waytynge boyes
vppon the playne grounde, fetche vs what wee caule for from the
cobbarde bysyde owr dynynge table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to the size of the trees the same writer avers, &ldquo;Owr men
measuringe manye of these trees, founde them to bee of suche biggnes,
that seuen men, ye sumetymes eight, holdinge hande in hande with theyr
armes streached furthe, were scarcely able to fathame them
aboute.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2061src" href="#xd21e2061"
name="xd21e2061src">24</a></p>
<p>Raleigh had evidently read some of these accounts about people
living on tree tops, but not satisfied with the Munchausen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>tales of
his predecessors, he proceeds to entertain his readers with stories as
marvelous as those of Sindbad the Sailor.</p>
<p>Writing of the Indians of the delta, he says: &ldquo;In the winter
they dwell vpon the trees, where they build very artificiall towns, and
villages, ... for between May and September, the riuer Orenoke riseth
thirtie foote vpright, and then are those Ilands ouerflowen twentie
foote high aboue the leuell of the ground, sauing some few raised
grounds in the middle of them.... They neuer eate of anie thing that is
set or sowen, and as at home they vse neither planting nor other
manurance, so when they com abroad the refuse to feede of ought but of
that which nature without labor bringeth foorth.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2070src" href="#xd21e2070" name=
"xd21e2070src">25</a></p>
<p>Of the Waraus, the Indians who inhabit the delta, the missionary,
Padre Gumilla, writes that when their islands are periodically
inundated by the rise of the Orinoco, they erect their huts on
piles&mdash;not on trees, as Raleigh states&mdash;above the water.
Furthermore, he tells us that these huts are made of the moriche palm,
which grows abundantly in these islands, and are covered with the
leaves of it. From the fibres of the leaf, they make their hammocks and
their cords for fishing and for bowstrings.</p>
<p>Around the pulpy shoot that ascends from the trunks is a web-like
integument that serves them for the slight covering they wear. On the
productions of this tree, also, they entirely subsist. The pulpy shoot
is eaten as cabbage, and the tree bears a fruit like the date, but
somewhat larger. When the inundation ceases, the tree is cut down, and
being perforated, a palatable juice exudes, from which they make a
drink. The interior substance of it is then taken out and thrown into
vessels of water and well washed and the ligneous fibres being removed,
a white sediment is deposited, which, dried in the sun, is made into a
very wholesome bread.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2077src" href=
"#xd21e2077" name="xd21e2077src">26</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>Accepting the foregoing statements as true, Humboldt philosophizes
as follows: &ldquo;It is curious to observe in the lowest degree of
civilization the existence of a whole tribe depending on a single
species of palm tree, similar to those insects which feed on one and
the same flower, or on one and the same part of a
plant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2107src" href="#xd21e2107"
name="xd21e2107src">27</a></p>
<p>Yet, notwithstanding all that has been written about the Indians of
the Orinoco delta living on the tops of trees, and depending on only
the moriche palm for food and raiment, it is certain that they do not
do so now, and it is almost equally certain that they have never done
so in the past. Truth to tell, these stories seem to repose on little
better foundation than those so long circulated and credited regarding
Lake Parime, and the great city of Manoa&mdash;the home of El
Dorado.</p>
<p>Raleigh had no time or opportunity to explore the delta, and there
is reason to believe that in this, as in other matters, he gave free
reign to his fancy to satisfy his reader&rsquo;s desire for the
marvelous. Gumilla, apparently, got his information regarding these
particular subjects at secondhand. He spent many years on the middle
Orinoco and some of its affluents, but there is no evidence that he was
ever in a position to verify the stories so long current regarding the
manner of living of the inhabitants of the delta.</p>
<p>The fact is, no one, so far as known, ever made any attempt to
explore the interior of the delta until more than two centuries after
Raleigh&rsquo;s time and until nearly a half <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>century
after Humboldt&rsquo;s visit to the valley of the Orinoco. As a
consequence, all that had been reported by earlier writers was
exaggeration and guesswork, if not pure invention.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Schomburgk, who, as Her Majesty&rsquo;s commissioner to
survey the boundaries of British Guiana, explored the delta in
1841&mdash;and some months of his sojourn there was during the rainy
season&mdash;states explicitly, that not in a single instance did he
find Indians dwelling on trees. &ldquo;We can well suppose that the
numerous fires which were made in each hut, and the reflection of which
was the stronger in consequence of the stream of vapor around the
summit of trees in those moist regions, illuminated at night the
adjacent trees; but the fire itself was scarcely ever made on the top
of a tree. The inundation rises at the delta seldom higher than three
or four feet above the banks of the rivers;&rdquo;&mdash;not twenty or
thirty feet, as Raleigh asserts&mdash;&ldquo;and if the immediate
neighborhood of the sea and the level nature of the land be considered,
this is an enormous rise.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2121src"
href="#xd21e2121" name="xd21e2121src">28</a></p>
<p>Herr Appun, who visited the delta some years subsequently to
Schomburgk&rsquo;s sojourn there, declares, &ldquo;I have lived more
than a year and a half among the Waraus of the Orinoco delta, and those
of the east coast of South America, from Cape Sabinetta to Cape Nassau,
at the mouth of the Pomeroon river in British Guiana, both during the
dry and the rainy season, and never have I beheld any of the aerial
dwellings that have been described.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2128src" href="#xd21e2128" name="xd21e2128src">29</a></p>
<p>The one, however, who has most thoroughly explored the interior of
the delta is Sr. Andres E. Level, who spent several years among the
Waraus, or Guaraunos, as they are called by the Spaniards. His
investigations have completely exploded the false notions so long
entertained regarding the delta and its inhabitants. The land is not
all an impassable swamp. Much of it is so elevated above <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>the
river that it is never reached by the high floods of the Orinoco.</p>
<p>Its soil is even more fertile than that of the Nile valley and
produces every tropical fruit and tree in the greatest profusion. Game
is abundant, and the Indians have extensive
<i>rancherias</i>&mdash;plantations&mdash;which supply them grain,
fruits and vegetables of all kinds. In the rivers near by they have the
greatest variety of fish, besides turtle that would be the delight of
the epicure.</p>
<p>As the Waraus of the interior are a timid people and have long since
learned to distrust the white man, they remain, as a rule, concealed in
the depths of forests that are impassable. They are, however, a quiet,
industrious, home-loving people, and are famous among the tribes in
this section of Guiana for their beautiful <i>curiaras</i>, or
canoes&mdash;made from a single log of the cedar, or of a tree called
Bioci. Some of these dugouts&mdash;the <i>monoxyla</i> of the
Greeks&mdash;are full fifty feet long and from five to six feet broad
and find a ready sale as far south as Demerara.</p>
<p>Far from being a dismal swamp, inhabited only by poor, starving
savages, condemned to live on tree tops, and to find food and clothing
in a single palm, Sr. Level<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2152src" href=
"#xd21e2152" name="xd21e2152src">30</a> shows us that the delta is a
garden of exceeding richness and that the Indians, if the government
did its duty towards them by developing the marvelous resources of
their land and by giving its inhabitants, so long neglected, some
measure of attention and assistance, would eventually make efficient
contributors to the national revenue, and become desirable citizens of
the republic. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=

&ldquo;The navigator,&rdquo; writes the illustrious savant, &ldquo;in
proceeding along the channels of the delta of the Orinoco at night,
sees with surprise the summit of the palm trees illumined by large
fires. These are the habitations of the Guarons (Titivitas and
Waraweties of Raleigh), which are suspended from the trunks of trees.
These tribes hang up mats in the air, which they fill with earth, and
kindle, on a layer of moist clay, the fire necessary for their
household wants. They had owed their liberty and their political
independence for ages to the quaking and swampy soil, which they pass
over in the time of drought, and on which they alone know how to walk
in security to their solitude in the delta of the Orinoco; to their
abode on the trees, where religious enthusiasm will probably never lead
any American stylites. Vol. III, Chap. XXV.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<h2 class="main">THE GREAT RIVER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What a wide river!&rdquo; was the exclamation
of a fellow-passenger as our steamer passed out of the Macareo and
turned the apex of the delta. It was, indeed, very wide, and the bank
of the Orinoco on our port-quarter was almost invisible. Here, even
during the dry season, this mighty water course is no less than four
leagues in width. We now, for the first time, fully realized that we
were sailing on the broad waters of one of the world&rsquo;s master
rivers. After the Parana and the Amazon, it is the largest waterway in
South America, and, for the volume of water it carries into the ocean,
it ranks with the Mississippi, the Congo, Yang-tse-Kiang, and the
Brahmaputra. Well have the natives of the lands through which it flows
named it the Great River&mdash;for it is great in every way&mdash;great
in the immense basin it drains; great in the tribute it carries to the
ocean, and great in the number and magnitude of the rivers it counts
among its affluents from the distant Cordilleras.</p>
<p>As along the Macareo, so here along the Orinoco, one never tires of
gazing at the magnificent forest trees and the dense shrubbery with
which the banks are fringed. At one time it is the wide-branched ceiba,
covered with bright-blooming epiphytes; at another a clump of graceful
moriche palms, whose tremulous plumes are given an added beauty by the
presence of a bevy of multicolored parrots and macaws. The foliage of
tree and shrub is here ever fresh and luxuriant and retains always that
delicate hue so characteristic of the leafage of our northern woodlands
in the early days of spring.</p>
<p>Most of the trees, large and small, are literally weighed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>down with parasites and epiphytes. Among the
latter growths are orchids of countless variety and rarest beauty, such
as are seldom seen in our northern floral conservatories. And the way
in which the trees are held together by those strange forms of
vegetable life&mdash;so abundant in the tropics&mdash;the
<i>bejucos</i> or bush ropes! Sometimes they are as thick as a
man&rsquo;s arm, sometimes they are like a ship&rsquo;s cable,
sometimes they may be mistaken for telegraph wires&mdash;so long and
fine are they. They extend from the ground to the tops of the highest
trees, or drop from the summits of the loftiest monarchs of the forest
to the earth beneath, sometimes singly, sometimes by scores. Then again
they cross one another from tree to tree and form a trelliswork that at
times is next to impassable. And these bejucos, or lianas, as they are
also called, are, like the trees, burdened with air-plants of various
species, at one time large masses of leaves, at another long spikes of
the richest blossoms.</p>
<p>At almost every turn the vision is delighted by lovely arboreal
groups and charming natural bowers, all graced with the most gorgeous
combinations of emerald foliage and ruby bloom&mdash;interspersed with
delicate tufts of lilac, pink and canary&mdash;and illumined by gleams
of flitting sunshine which bring out a glorious play of color effects
with which the eye is never tired. &ldquo;A dryad&rsquo;s home,&rdquo;
we heard an enthusiastic se&ntilde;orita exclaim, as we passed one of
these flower-decked bowers, on which glittered the checkered sunlight.
And so well it might be, it was so rare a gem of sylvan loveliness.</p>
<p>While passing up this majestic river and admiring the ever-varying
panorama of rarest floral beauty, we recalled a couple of paragraphs in
Darwin&rsquo;s <i>Journal of Researches</i>, in which he refers to the
futility of attempting to describe, for one who has never visited the
tropics, the wonders of the scenery there and above all the marvels of
the vegetable world. He expresses himself as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such are the elements of the scenery, but it is a hopeless
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>attempt to paint the general effect. Learned
naturalists describe these scenes of the tropics by naming a multitude
of objects, and mentioning some characteristic feature of each. To a
learned traveler this possibly may communicate some definite ideas; but
who else from seeing a plant in an herbarium can imagine its appearance
when growing in its native soil? Who from seeing choice plants in a
hothouse, can magnify some into the dimensions of forest trees, and
crowd others into an entangled jungle? Who, when examining in the
cabinet of the entomologist the gay exotic butterflies, and singular
cicadas, will associate with these lifeless objects, the ceaseless
harsh music of the latter, and the lazy flight of the former&mdash;the
sure accompaniments of the still, glowing noonday of the tropics? It is
when the sun has attained its greatest height, that such scenes should
be viewed; then the dense, splendid foliage of the mango hides the
ground with its darkest shade, whilst the upper branches are rendered,
from the profusion of light, of the most brilliant green. In the
temperate zones the case is different&mdash;the vegetation there is not
so dark or so rich, and hence the rays of the declining sun, tinged of
a red, purple, or bright yellow color, add most to the beauties of
those climes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When quietly walking along the shady pathways, and admiring
each successive view, I wished to find language to express my ideas.
Epithet after epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have
not visited the intertropical regions, the sensation of delight which
the mind experiences. I have said that the plants in a hothouse fail to
communicate a just idea of the vegetation, yet I must recur to it. The
land is one great wild, untidy, luxuriant hothouse, made by Nature for
herself, but taken possession of by man, who has studded it with gay
houses and formal gardens. How great would be the desire in every
admirer of Nature to behold, if such were possible, the scenery of
another planet! yet to every person in Europe, it may be truly said,
that at the distance of only a few degrees from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>his
native soil, the glories of another world are opened to him. In my last
walk I stopped again and again to gaze on these beauties, and
endeavored to fix in my mind for ever, an impression which at the time
I knew sooner or later must fail. The form of the orange tree, the
cocoa-nut, the palm, the mango, the tree-fern, the banana, will remain
clear and separate; but the thousand beauties which unite these into
one perfect scene must fade away; yet they will leave, like a tale
heard in childhood, a picture full of indistinct, but most beautiful
figures.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2193src" href="#xd21e2193"
name="xd21e2193src">1</a></p>
<p>While the flora of the Orinoco, near the apex of the delta, is so
varied and exuberant, but little is seen of its fauna, notwithstanding
all that has been said and written to the contrary. In a recent work,
for instance, written by one who pretends to have made the trip from
Trinidad, is a sentence that will equal any of the extravagances of
Jules Verne&rsquo;s <i lang="fr">Le Superbe Or&eacute;noque</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jaguar,&rdquo; says the author, &ldquo;will stop
drinking, or the tapir look up from browsing on the grass, and the
monkey pause in swinging from tree to tree, as the boats hurry noisily
by, while the drowsy alligator or manatee floats lazily on, his head
half out of the water, until perhaps a conical bullet from a Winchester
rifle or from a revolver, which everyone carries, rouses him to a
knowledge that it is not good to trust too much to mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite safe to say that neither the author of the work quoted
nor any one else has ever seen a jaguar, or a tapir or a manatee under
the circumstances mentioned. They are all timid animals and are never
seen from the deck of noisy steamers.</p>
<p>Although we saw no quadrupeds like those just mentioned, there were
countless birds, large and small. Those that were most conspicuous were
ibises, flamingoes and herons of various species. So numerous at times
were the flamingoes that, to borrow an idea from Trowbridge, the
sunrise flame of their reflected forms actually crimsoned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>&ldquo;the glassy wave and glistening
sands.&rdquo; Of the herons, the largest species is named by the
natives <i>soldado</i>&mdash;a soldier&mdash;so called both from its
size and the stately attitude it assumes, which, at a distance, gives
it the appearance of a sentry on duty.</p>
<p>A flock of these tall, white birds, seen feeding in an everglade in
Cuba was, during the second voyage of Columbus, taken for a party of
men clad in white tunics, and led the Admiral to believe that they were
inhabitants of Mangon, a province just south of Cathay. Indeed, so
striking is their resemblance to men posted as sentinels that,
according to Humboldt, &ldquo;the inhabitants of Angostura, soon after
the foundation of their city, were one day alarmed by the sudden
appearance of <i>soldados</i> and <i>garzas</i>, on a mountain towards
the south. They believed they were menaced with an attack of <i>Indios
monteros</i>, wild Indians, called mountaineers; and the people were
not perfectly tranquilized till they saw the birds soaring in the air
and continuing their migration towards the mouths of the
Orinoco.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2224src" href="#xd21e2224"
name="xd21e2224src">2</a></p>
<p>Our first stopping place was Barrancas, a small and squalid village
of mud, palm-thatched huts. It is situated in the centre of one of the
finest grazing regions of Venezuela and under a wise and progressive
government, would soon become a place of considerable importance.</p>
<p>In the time of the Franciscan Missions here, suppressed nearly a
century ago, the herds that roamed the beautiful undulating prairies on
both sides of the Orinoco counted no fewer than one hundred and fifty
thousand cattle, and with the markets that could easily be had for beef
and hides, this number could, under favorable conditions, be greatly
increased. As it is, however, it is known rather as a favorite
rendezvous for that numerous class of revolutionists for whom the
country is so noted, that have been born insolvent, but who, by
grandiloquent <i>pronunciamientos</i>, and through the co&ouml;peration
of hungry spoil-seekers like themselves, hope one day to improve their
financial condition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87"
name="pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>Near Barrancas we were shown the spot where General Antonio Paredes
and his confiding followers were shot in cold blood, a few days before
our arrival, in pursuance of an order, we were told, that President
Castro had issued from his sick bed in Macuto. This speedy, albeit
unconstitutional, disposition of the leaders of what was heralded as a
great popular reform movement was designed to put a quietus on other
revolutionists who were making or preparing to make
<i>pronunciamientos</i> in various parts of the republic. It did not,
however, seem to have the desired effect, as during our sojourn in the
country two other revolutions cropped out when least expected. For a
while one of these gave the government very grave concern but was
finally suppressed; not, however, until the country had suffered by
anticipation many of the miseries of internecine strife.</p>
<p>Before our departure from Caracas, we tried in vain to get some
information not only about the dates of sailing of the Orinoco steamers
but also about their character. After leaving the capital, some of our
friends tried to dissuade us from our projected trip to Ciudad Bolivar,
assuring us that the only craft plying up and down the river were
filthy cattle boats unfit for a white man to enter. Imagine our
surprise, then, when we found that our vessel, far from being the
unclean, poorly-provisioned boat that had been pictured to us, was in
every way fairly comfortable, and with a cuisine and service that were
far from bad. In construction and general arrangement, it was not
unlike the smaller double-decked steamers on the Hudson river or on our
northern lakes. Our cabins were spacious, with broad berths, and clean
bedding and furniture. Indeed, we have often had cabins in our large
transatlantic steamers in which there was less of comfort and
convenience than were afforded by our cabin in this unpretending boat
on the Orinoco.</p>
<p>As to the passengers, they were quite a cosmopolitan crowd. Among
them were some Europeans and several <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>Americans, but the
greater number were Venezuelans&mdash;most of them bound for Ciudad
Bolivar. Of the Americans there were two men in quest of fortune in the
celebrated Yuruari mining district in southern Guiana.</p>
<p>The upper deck of the boat was reserved for the first-class
passengers, while the lower one was occupied by those of the
second-class, and by such freight as was carried up and down the river.
On returning to the Port-of-Spain, the steamer usually carried about
two hundred head of cattle for the Trinidad market. When these were
taken on board at night, as sometimes happened, sleep was impossible.
What with the tramping and bellowing of the affrighted brutes below us
and the shouting of the cattlemen and crew, there was a veritable
pandemonium which continued the greater part of the night.</p>
<p>Frequently there are not enough cabins for the passengers. But this
makes very little difference to the Venezuelan. He simply swings his
<i>chinchorro</i>&mdash;hammock&mdash;between two stanchions of the
vessel and is soon calmly reposing in slumberland. Indeed, many of the
inhabitants of the tropics prefer a hammock to a bed, and do not apply
for a stateroom when traveling on the rivers of equatorial America.</p>
<p>The second-class passengers sleep in their hammocks if they happen
to have them; if not, they lie down anywhere they can find room and are
soon fast asleep. Many of them have no beds at home, except a mat, a
rawhide, or the lap of Mother Earth, and the absence of a bed or
hammock is no appreciable privation to them.</p>
<p>There is no more curious sight than is presented at night on a
crowded river steamer in the tropics. One sees scores of hammocks swung
in every conceivable place. All davits and stanchions, all uprights and
crosspieces are provided with hooks and rings, so that hammocks, when
necessary, may be attached to them. In saloons and passageways, on
forward-deck and after-deck, wherever there is any available space,
there is stretched on the floor, or snugly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>ensconced in his chinchorro, some quietly sleeping
or loudly snoring specimen of humanity. Sometimes one will see several
persons stowed away in a single hammock. It is not an unusual thing to
see two persons in the same chinchorro, and one may now and then see a
mother and three children serenely reposing in one of these aerial
cots. How they do it, it is difficult to say, but the fact is that they
do it, and there is apparently not a budge in the hammock&rsquo;s
occupants until they are awakened in the morning by the call of the
birds&mdash;Nature&rsquo;s alarm clocks in the tropics.</p>
<p>A place of more than passing interest between Barrancas and Ciudad
Bolivar is Los Castillos, formerly Guayana la Vieja, founded by Antonio
de Berrio in 1591. It was here, in 1618, that young Walter Raleigh, the
son of the Admiral, lost his life in an encounter with the Spaniards
who had possession of this stronghold. It was near here, also, that
Bolivar, at a critical hour during the War of Independence, saved his
life by hiding in a swamp near the village.</p>
<p>About ten leagues further up the river, at the mouth of the Caroni,
and opposite the island of Fajardo, Diego de Ordaz&mdash;the officer
under Cortes who got sulphur out of the crater of
Popocatepetl&mdash;found in 1531 a settlement called Carao during his
exploration of the Orinoco. This was afterwards named Santo Tom&eacute;
de Guayana, and was for a short time a missionary centre&mdash;the
first on the Orinoco. It was, however, destroyed in 1579 by the Dutch
under Jansen. There is little now at this point to interest the
traveler except the beautiful <i>Salto</i>&mdash;cataract&mdash;of the
Caroni river, so celebrated for its picturesque scenery, and the wealth
of orchideous plants with which the adjacent trees are clothed. Raleigh
in describing these falls says that so great was the mass of vapor due
to the fury and rebound of the waters that &ldquo;we tooke it at the
first for a smoke that had risen ouer some great towne,&rdquo; and
Padre Caulin, in his description of it, says the roar of the cataract
is so great that it can be heard at a distance of several <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>leagues.
Both these accounts are quite exaggerated. The falls are very beautiful
and romantic, but by no means so grand or so imposing as they have been
depicted.</p>
<p>Near the confluence of the Caroni and the Orinoco is the straggling
little town of San Felix. At this point our mining party left us for
their long journey of one hundred and fifty miles on mule-back to
Callao. They gave us a cordial invitation to accompany them, but we had
other plans, and, although we should have enjoyed exploring this famous
mining district of southern Guiana, we felt constrained to continue our
course westwards.</p>
<p>For a number of years the Yuruari mining district promised to equal,
if not surpass, the most famous gold fields of Nevada and California.
One of the mines, the Callao, rivaled the great Comstock mines of
Virginia City, and for &ldquo;a considerable period,&rdquo; we are
assured, &ldquo;original shares of 1,000 pesos produced dividends of
72,000 pesos yearly.&rdquo; In 1895, however, the main lode was lost,
and since that time, owing to lack of funds, little has been done in
any of the mines in the district. The owners of the Callao mine still
hope to find the lost lode, and it was to investigate the condition of
this mine, and of certain others in the neighborhood, that our American
friends undertook their long trip southwards. If the outlook justifies
it, they purpose improving the present wretched cart-road, which
connects the mines with San Felix, and putting on suitable traction
engines for the transportation of freight, which has hitherto been
carried on the backs of burros and in carts of the most primitive
type.</p>
<p>During the halcyon days of the Callao mine, when all eyes were
directed towards this quarter of the world, a certain syndicate tried
to secure from the government a concession for building a railroad from
the Orinoco to the Yuruari gold fields. The then president of Venezuela
was quite willing to grant the concession, but insisted, it is said, on
having by anticipation a much larger share of the prospective profits
of the road than the company was willing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>to give. Had the railway
been constructed, there is no doubt that many other valuable mines
would have been developed, and that southeastern Guiana would soon have
become one of the most productive regions of the republic. The road
would have benefited not only the mining interests but would have led
to a rapid development of the grazing and agricultural industries,
which, in this part of Venezuela, could, under favorable conditions, be
second only to those of the llanos of the Apure, and of the fertile
plains of the states of Bermudez and Bolivar.</p>
<p>Aside from the interest that attaches to this part of South America,
on account of its many scenic attractions and its varied natural
resources of forest and field and mine, it will always possess an added
interest by reason of its connection with Raleigh&rsquo;s ill-fated
search for El Dorado. When his purse became depleted, and he had fallen
from the favor of Queen Elizabeth&mdash;who for a while was so
&ldquo;much taken with his elocution&rdquo; that she &ldquo;took him
for a kind of oracle&rdquo;&mdash;he bethought him of retrieving
fortune and favor by the discovery and conquest of a second Incaic
empire, and, with this end in view, he projected his famous voyage
to</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e2280">&ldquo;Yet unspoil&rsquo;d</p>
<p class="line">Guiana, whose great city Geryon&rsquo;s sons</p>
<p class="line">Call El Dorado.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is beside my purpose to comment on the
&ldquo;cruell and blood-thirsty Amazones,&rdquo; and the race of people
who &ldquo;haue their eyes in their shoulders, and their mouths in the
middle of their breasts,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2288src"
href="#xd21e2288" name="xd21e2288src">3</a> about whom Raleigh writes
in his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>remarkable book, so often quoted, <i>The
Discoverie of Gviana</i>, and which caused Hume to brand the work as
being a tissue of &ldquo;the grossest and most palpable lies.&rdquo; We
are here interested only in what he says about the finding of gold in
the region bordering the Caroni and in his fantastic tales regarding El
Dorado.<a class="noteref" id="n92.1src" href="#n92.1" name=
"n92.1src">4</a></p>
<p>Whether Raleigh himself really believed in the existence of El
Dorado, such as he has described it, or whether he wished to work on
the imaginations of his countrymen, who were as credulous and as great
lovers of the marvelous as were their contemporaries on the continent
of Europe, cannot be affirmed with certainty. It is probable that he
possessed a full share of the credulity of his age, and that, if he
embellished his accounts of what he saw or exaggerated the reports
which he received from the aborigines, he really gave credence to the
leading features of the extraordinary stories that were then current
regarding the fabulous riches of the great city of Manoa.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n92.1">4</a></p>
<p>And he was most likely in earnest when he declared that
&ldquo;whatsoeuer Prince shall possess
it&rdquo;&mdash;Guiana&mdash;&ldquo;that Prince shal be Lorde of more
gold, and of a more beautifull Empire, and of more Cities and people,
then eyther the King of Spayne, or the great Turke,&rdquo; and was
probably honest in the belief that he who should &ldquo;conquerere the
same,&rdquo; would &ldquo;performe more than euer was done in Mexico by
Cortez, or in Peru by Pacaro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New World was, for the people of the Old, still a land of
mystery and enchantment, and the great majority <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>of the
adventurers in the newly discovered lands were quite ready to credit
the wildest tales, and follow the most elusive phantoms, provided they
gave indications, however slight, of the possibility of satisfying that
<i lang="la">auri sacra fames</i> which consumed the poor and rich
alike.</p>
<p>The remarkable thing about Raleigh is that he actually found gold
and gold-bearing quartz in the land watered by the Caroni, and located
the capital of El Dorado near where the great Callao mine was
discovered nearly three centuries later. And not only did he discover
gold-bearing quartz, but he found a variety of gold quartz essentially
the same as that which occurs in the Yuruari districts. It is
interesting to speculate what effect the actual discovery by him of the
Callao mine would have had on his subsequent career and on
England&rsquo;s schemes of expansion in the Western Hemisphere. One
thing is certain. He would have recouped his lost fortunes, and his
head, in all probability, would never have fallen on the block in Old
Palace Yard.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2334src" href="#xd21e2334"

<p>The following is Raleigh&rsquo;s r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the riches
and marvels of Guiana and the Orinoco valley, and at the same time a
sample of the stories then current regarding the land of El
Dorado&mdash;stories which those to whom the writer appealed, found
little difficulty in accepting as unquestioned expressions of
unvarnished truth:</p>

<p>Although we were intensely interested in the fauna and flora of the
Orinoco, and never tired of the magnificent prospects, which, like an
ever-changing panorama, were constantly presented to our view, we found
time to observe the native population, especially the Indians, who are
seen in considerable numbers along the entire course of the river. In
the Delta and in its immediate neighborhood, they are represented
chiefly by the Waraus, Aruacs, and Caribs.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e2374width" id="p094"><img src="images/p094.jpg"
alt="An Indian Home on the Orinoco." width="459" height="720">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">An Indian Home on the
Orinoco.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Waraus have a slightly darker complexion than either the Aruacs
or Caribs. Owing to their lack of personal cleanliness, and the amount
of oil with which they besmear their bodies, their hue becomes so dark,
that, were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>it not for their straight hair, it would at times
be difficult to distinguish them from negroes. In consequence of their
careless habits regarding their persons and places of abode, and the
way in which they neglect their children, they are despised by the
neighboring tribes. Their rude huts, often no more than a little palm
thatch supported by a few uprights, afford them but little protection
from sun and rain. With these, however, they seem to be quite
satisfied.</p>
<p>The Aruacs found here belong to that great group of Indians that, at
the time of the arrival of the Spaniards in the New World, inhabited
all the large islands of the Antilles. According to ethnologists, their
original home was probably on the eastern slopes of the Bolivian
Cordilleras. Thence they migrated towards the north and east and
constituted for a time one of the most powerful races in the Western
Hemisphere.</p>
<p>They are also one of the oldest of the great South American tribes.
They were the first Indians with whom the Spaniards came in contact and
are to-day, as they were in the time of Columbus, a friendly,
good-natured, peace-loving people, in spite of all the harsh treatment
their forefathers received from their cruel conquerors. They are fairer
than either the Waraus or the Caribs, and their women are reputed the
most beautiful of all the native Guianians.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2387src" href="#xd21e2387" name="xd21e2387src">7</a> Their hair
is occasionally so long that it reaches the ground, and, although they
sometimes do it up and in the most tasteful manner, they usually allow
it to fall over their shoulders. They anoint it daily with Carapa nut
oil, and seem to realize as fully as do their white sisters in the
north, that &ldquo;a woman&rsquo;s glory is in her
hair.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2396src" href="#xd21e2396"
name="xd21e2396src">8</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Caribs here referred to belong to that dread race of whom
Columbus heard such blood-curdling stories from the peaceful
inhabitants of Cuba and Espa&ntilde;ola. They are, too, among the
youngest of the great migratory races of South America, and their
original abode seems to have been in the upper basins of the Xingu and
Tapajos, two of the great affluents of the Amazon.</p>
<p>Descending these rivers, they took possession of the greater part of
the continent bordering the Atlantic from the mouth of the Amazon to
the Caribbean sea, which is named from them. Subsequently, in large
fleets of canoes, in making which they excelled, they pushed their way
up the Orinoco and its principal tributaries, spreading death and
destruction wherever they went. And not satisfied with their conquests
on land, they eventually extended their dominion over the islands of
the Lesser Antilles as far as St. Thomas. Had it not been for the
timely arrival of the Spaniards, there is no doubt that they would have
driven the peaceful Waraus out of the Greater Antilles, as they had
forced them from their other homes in the islands to the southeast and
on the mainland of South America.</p>
<p>They were the terror of all the tribes with whom they came in
contact. They enslaved the women, and celebrated their victories by
devouring the men. They were the cannibals who so strenuously opposed
the Spaniards on many a bloody field, and who, it is alleged,
celebrated their victory over the white invader by serving up, at their
savage banquets, the captives taken in ambush or in battle. Indeed, the
word cannibal is but a corruption of the word Carib.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2411src" href="#xd21e2411" name="xd21e2411src">9</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>For many generations they preyed on the peaceful
Indians of the missions of the Orinoco basin and elsewhere, and time
and again the zealous missionary saw the work of years undone in a few
moments by the sudden onslaught of these dread and ruthless
visitants.</p>
<p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Spanish Franciscans,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>the Caribs who inhabit the eastern part of
Venezuela were eventually civilized and Christianized, and converted
from wild nomads into peaceful and useful citizens, having their own
towns and villages. They were chiefly engaged in the breeding of cattle
and in agriculture.</p>
<p>A century ago there were in the territory bounded by the Caroni, the
Cuyuni and the Orinoco no fewer than thirty-eight missions, with
sixteen thousand civilized Indians. But by decrees promulgated by the
Republic of Colombia in the years 1819 and 1821 these missions were
suppressed and to-day one sees scarcely a vestige of their former
existence. The Indians are not only much less numerous than formerly,
but most of them have returned to the mode of life they led before the
advent of the missionary. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p>They are, as a rule, peaceful and harmless, but as they have been so
long neglected by the government, their social status is but little
above that of their savage ancestors. More is the pity. The suppression
of the missions here was followed by the same consequences as resulted
from the suppression of the missions in Paraguay and
elsewhere&mdash;the relapse of the Indians into savagery and the loss
to the state of thousands of useful and worthy citizens. It is
difficult to see the wisdom of thus eliminating from the body politic
elements so prolific of good and so essential to the public weal.</p>
<p>P&egrave;re Labat, referring to the language of the Caribs, writes
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Caribs have three kinds of language. The
first, the most ordinary, and that which every one speaks, is the one
affected by the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second is so proper to the women, that, although the men
understand it, they would consider themselves dishonored if they spoke
it, or if they answered their women in case they had the temerity to
address them in this language. They&mdash;the women&mdash;know the
language of their husbands, and must make use of it when they speak to
them, but they never use it when they talk among themselves, nor do
they employ any language but the one peculiar to themselves, which is
entirely different from that of the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a third language, which is known only by the men who
have been in war, and particularly by the old men. It is rather a
jargon than a language. They use it in important assemblies of which
they desire to keep the resolutions secret. The women and young men are
ignorant of it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2466src" href=
"#xd21e2466" name="xd21e2466src">10</a></p>
<p>This statement was for a long time discredited, and classed among
those fables regarding the New World that were unworthy of the
attention of serious men. Later on it was discovered that the
<i>victoriosa loquacitas</i> of the charming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>monk
was based on fact. But the next thing was to explain the fact. On
investigation it was found that something similar exists among other
Indian tribes of South America, as, for instance, among the Guaranis,
the Chiquitos, the Omaguas and the Quichuas.</p>
<p>In explanation of this strange phenomenon, it was then suggested
&ldquo;that women, from their separate way of life, frame particular
terms which men do not adopt.&rdquo; Cicero observes that old forms of
language are best preserved by women, because, by their position in
society, they are less exposed to those vicissitudes of life, changes
of place and occupation, which tend to corrupt the primitive purity of
language among men.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2480src" href=
"#xd21e2480" name="xd21e2480src">11</a></p>
<p>This suggestion, ingenious though it be, was far from satisfactory
to philologists and ethnologists. The quest, therefore, for a solution
of the strange problem, was continued with renewed interest, and with
the result that the mystery was at length completely solved. As has
been stated, it was the custom of the Caribs in their wars with other
Indian tribes to massacre the men and reduce the women to servitude. In
some instances many of the women and not infrequently the majority of
them became the wives of their conquerors. But even after this enforced
alliance, the women retained their own language. The consequence was
that, in families thus constituted, there were two languages
spoken&mdash;that of the conqueror and that of the conquered.</p>
<p>While, however, the general accuracy of P&egrave;re Labat&rsquo;s
statements were thus put beyond further doubt, it was discovered, by a
comparative study of the languages of the Caribs and those of the
tribes which they had subjugated, that it was not strictly true to
assert that the language of the women was entirely different from that
of the men&mdash;<i lang="fr">totalement different de celui des
hommes</i>&mdash;as the good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>Dominican had affirmed. They were
entirely different in the words of daily use and of most frequent
occurrence, but the difference extended in reality only to the minor
part of the vocabulary actually employed. But the difference was quite
sufficient to justify the interest it had so long excited among men of
science, and to stimulate the researches which have only in recent
years been crowned with success.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2495src"
href="#xd21e2495" name="xd21e2495src">12</a></p>
<p>The night before arriving at Ciudad Bolivar, while dreamily
reclining in a steamer chair, I was awakened from my musings by a
vivacious senorita, of pronounced Castilian type, rushing up to her
father, near by, and exclaiming in an excited manner,
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Mira, padre, mira, la Cruz del
Sur!</span>&rdquo; Look, father, look&mdash;the Southern Cross! And
sure enough, there, in the constellation Centauri, was the &ldquo;Croce
Maravigliosa,&rdquo;&mdash;the marvelous cross&mdash;of the early
navigators, the &ldquo;Crucero&rdquo; of incomparable beauty and
brightness, the celestial clock of the early missionaries in the
tropical lands of the New World. The cloud-veiled skies of the
preceding nights had prevented us from getting a view of these
&ldquo;<i lang="la">luci sante</i>&rdquo;&mdash;holy lights&mdash;but
now we were privileged to behold them in all their heavenly splendor.
At once we recalled that well-known passage of Dante, which the lovers
of the great Florentine have applied to this constellation:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;To the right hand I turned, and fixed my
mind,</p>
<p class="line">On the other pole attentive, where I saw</p>
<p class="line">Four stars ne&rsquo;er seen before save by the ken</p>
<p class="line">Of our first parents. Heaven of their rays <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Seemed joyous. O, thou northern site! bereft</p>
<p class="line">Indeed, and widened, since of these
deprived!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2546src" href="#xd21e2546"
name="xd21e2546src">13</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">We never suspected it at the time, but as subsequent
events proved, the se&ntilde;orita&rsquo;s Cruz del Sur was to be our
timepiece for many subsequent months. During long wanderings over
mountain and plain and in many changing climes, it was the Southern
Cross that served as our guide, and marked the hours of night, in lieu
of Polaris and Ursa Major, which had disappeared below the horizon.</p>
<p>Toward noon, the second day after leaving the Port-of-Spain, we got
our first view of Ciudad Bolivar, founded in 1764 by Joaquin Moreno de
Mendoza, and since that time the capital of Guiana, now the great State
of Bolivar. Situated upon an eminence, on the right bank of the river,
it presents a very imposing appearance and seems much larger than it is
in reality. The white stone walls of the houses, and the brownish-red
tiles of the roofs, together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>with the delicate green crowns of
lofty palms that dot every part of the city, enhance in a marked degree
the beauty of the picture as seen under the brilliant light of the
noonday sun. The cathedral, and the government buildings around the
plaza in the higher part of the town, loom up with splendid effect.
Indeed, it would be difficult to find a more beautiful picture of a
city, when seen at a distance, than is that of Ciudad Bolivar.</p>
<p>As one approaches this metropolis of the Orinoco basin, the details
of the city come gradually into view. Parallel with the river bank is
the principal business street&mdash;La Calle del Coco&mdash;which is at
the same time the most delightful promenade in the place. Here is the
custom-house, the American and other consulates, and a number of large
mercantile establishments, controlled chiefly by Germans, Americans and
Corsicans.</p>
<p>From a broad waterway, from two to three miles in width, the river
here contracts to a narrow channel which, at low water, is not more
than a half mile in width. According to Codazzi,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2580src" href="#xd21e2580" name="xd21e2580src">14</a> the mean
depth of the river at this point is sixty feet. Towards the end of the
rainy season, however, the water rises from forty to fifty feet above
low-water mark. Sometimes it rises considerably higher. In 1891 the
flood was so high that the stores and dwellings of the part of the city
fronting the river were inundated to a height of several feet. Then the
inhabitants were obliged to have recourse to canoes in passing from
house to house. Then, too, stray alligators were seen in the streets
and it was possible to catch enough fish for a meal in the
<i>patio</i>&mdash;court-yard&mdash;of one&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>The original name of the city was Santo Tom&eacute; de la Nueva
Guayana&mdash;the third place on the river to bear this name. The
first, it will be remembered, was situated at the confluence of the
Caroni and the Orinoco and was destroyed by the Dutch in 1579. The
second, now known as Los Castillos&mdash;formerly Guayana la
Vieja&mdash;was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>founded by Antonio de Berrio in 1591, and
is famous in the history of this part of Venezuela for its vigorous
resistance to Sir Walter Raleigh, whom Spanish writers designate as the
&ldquo;great pirate Gualtero Reali.&rdquo; As the inhabitants found the
first name of their city inconveniently long they called it
Angostura&mdash;the Narrows&mdash;from the contraction of the river at
this point. The name was so appropriate that it is a pity it could not
have been retained. In 1819, however, Congress gave it the name of
Ciudad Bolivar, in honor of Simon Bolivar, the Liberator of South
America.</p>
<p>As our steamer neared the steep bank in front of the city our
attention was arrested by a large, dark, granitic mass&mdash;<i>La
Piedra del Medio</i>&mdash;looming up in the middle of the river. Like
the celebrated Nileometer at Cairo, this rock, which may appropriately
be called an Orinocometer, serves as a gauge of the annual rise of the
flood. As we passed it, we could see distinctly the height to which the
waters had risen the preceding year.</p>
<p>If ever the long-talked-of railroad from Caracas to Ciudad Bolivar
shall be constructed, this rock, almost midway between the latter city
and Soledad, a small town on the opposite side of the river, will serve
as an invaluable pier for the bridge that is planned to span the
Orinoco at this point. Until, however, the country shall have a more
stable government than it has now, and until foreign capital shall have
more confidence in the future of the republic than it has at present,
it is quite safe to say that there will be neither bridge nor railroad,
although both are very much needed to develop the vast resources of
this section of Venezuela.</p>
<p>In its location and surroundings, Ciudad Bolivar possesses all the
essential elements of a beautiful and prosperous metropolis. It
controls the trade of the immense Orinoco basin, and the amount of
business transacted here should, under favorable conditions, be many
times what it is at present. But, at the time of our visit, everything
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>was in a state of abandonment that was sad to
behold. The streets, parks and public buildings, which could easily be
made the most attractive features of the city, were in a neglected
condition, and the number of vacant houses in certain sections, some
crumbling into ruins, showed the inevitable effects of protracted
misrule and periodic turmoil.</p>
<p>When I asked one of the prominent merchants of the city the reason
for the deplorable state referred to, he replied:&mdash;&rdquo;<i lang=
"es">No hay dinero. Hay tantas revoluciones.</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;There
is no money. There are so many revolutions.&rdquo;) And when I sought a
reason for the business lethargy everywhere manifested, a similar reply
was forthcoming. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Somos pobres, estamos arruinados.
Hay tantas guerras y el gobierno es
mal&iacute;simo.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;We are poor, ruined. There
have been so many wars and the government is very bad.&rdquo;)
Merchants, tradesmen, day-laborers, professional men&mdash;all, except
government employees, who were interested in retaining their positions
as long as possible, had the same pitiful story to relate.</p>
<p>Oppressive taxes, exorbitant prices for many of the necessaries of
life, intolerable monopolies, controlled by leading government
officials or their favorites, had reduced the majority of the
population to a condition bordering on despair. No encouragement was
given to foreign capital for the exploitation and development of the
immense natural resources of the country. On the contrary, foreigners
were looked upon with suspicion, while Castro and his henchmen were
openly antagonistic to them. Nor was it only in Ciudad Bolivar and in
other parts of the Orinoco valley that this lamentable condition of
things obtained. We found the same business depression, the same
hopeless outlook in Caracas, Valencia, Puerto Cabello, and other
commercial centres of the republic. Small wonder, then, was it that the
discouraged, downtrodden people were longing and praying for a change
in the administration.</p>
<p>The long desired change came at last, and in a way that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>no
one could have foreseen. The dramatic downfall of Castro suddenly and
unexpectedly opened the way to an amelioration of conditions that had
become intolerable, while the accession of Gomez to power has inspired
all patriotic and peace-loving Venezuelans with the hope that their
long distracted country is about to enter upon a new era&mdash;an era
of social progress and business prosperity&mdash;an era of amity with
other nations accompanied by a spirit of comity which was so long
conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the comparatively large number of vessels that come
to this place, there is no wharf, and people here say that the great
rise and fall of the river make it impossible to construct one.
Fortunately, it is not a prime necessity, as the water, even in the dry
season, is so deep that the largest vessels can approach so near the
bank that both freight and passengers can be discharged by an ordinary
gangplank.</p>
<p>Our steamer, like all the others there, was moored head and stern by
cables leading to the venerable Ceiba trees that lined la Calle del
Coco high above us. The inclination of the bank, where merchandise is
landed, amounts in places to almost 45&deg;, and yet no machinery of
any kind is used for transferring even the heaviest kinds of freight
from the vessel to the top of the acclivity. All is carried on the
shoulders of men, usually mestizos and negroes.</p>
<p>We spent a week in and around Ciudad Bolivar, and, during this time,
we had ample opportunities to study the manners and customs of its
people. The population of the city is not more than twelve or thirteen
thousand&mdash;a small number for the entrepot of the immense Orinoco
basin. Under less untoward conditions it would be many times as
great.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2624src" href="#xd21e2624" name=
"xd21e2624src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>To this place are brought the products of the forests and plains of
the upper Orinoco and its numerous tributaries. Among the most
important articles of export are hides, rubber&mdash;especially the
coarser variety known as balata&mdash;cacao, coffee, and tobacco from
Zamora, pelts of the jaguar and other wild animals, tonka beans,
copaiba and feathers.</p>
<p>The last item is amazing, when one considers what a slaughter of the
feathered tribe it implies. We met a Frenchman here who was just
packing for shipment to Paris several hundred thousand egrets, the
result of a three-years&rsquo; hunt in the forests and plains of the
Orinoco basin. But he was not the only one engaged in this wholesale
slaughter of birds. There were many others, and their work of
despoiling the tropics of their most attractive ornaments extends to
all the vast regions on both sides of the equator.</p>
<p>The small egret&mdash;<i>Ardea candidissima</i>&mdash;which supplies
the most valuable plumes, and the large egret&mdash;<i>Ardea
garzetta</i>&mdash;which produces a coarser feather, are the principal
victims. As only a few drooping plumes from the backs of the birds are
taken, one can readily see what a terrific slaughter is required to
meet the demands of the markets of the world.</p>
<p>The worst feature about the business is that the birds are killed
during the mating and breeding season. Already the result is manifest
in the rapidly diminishing numbers of egrets that frequent the
<i>garceros</i>&mdash;the name given to the places where they nest and
rear their young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of a few feathers on their backs,&rdquo; writes
one who, if not a misogynist, is evidently in sympathy with the aims
and purposes of our Audubon society, &ldquo;will be the cause of their
extinction. The love of adornment common to most animals is the source
of their troubles. The graceful plumes which they doubtless admire in
each other have appealed to the vanity of the most destructive of all
animals. They are doomed, because the women of civilized <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>countries continue to have the same fondness for
feathers and ornaments characteristic of savage tribes.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2652src" href="#xd21e2652" name=
"xd21e2652src">16</a></p>
<p>The houses of Ciudad Bolivar, built on a hill of dark, almost bare
hornblende-schist, are in marked contrast with those of the
Port-of-Spain. In Trinidad&rsquo;s capital each residence&mdash;usually
frame&mdash;is provided with numerous doors, and jalousied windows, and
surrounded by gardens, with a profusion of the most beautiful tropical
flowers and trees. Here, on the contrary, the houses, generally only
one story high, have but one door, with all the external windows
crossed by heavy iron bars, not unlike those of our jails.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2659src" href="#xd21e2659" name=
"xd21e2659src">17</a></p>
<p>This, however, is not peculiar to Ciudad Bolivar, but obtains
throughout Latin America, as it obtains in all the parts of Spain
formerly occupied by the Moors. Yet these windows, which are in
themselves so forbidding, are in the cool of the evening the most
attractive parts of the house. Here bevies of bright, well-dressed
se&ntilde;oritas, who, during the heat of the day remain secluded in
their rooms or some shady corner of the <i>patio</i>, congregate to
enjoy the fresh air that is wafted to them on the wings of the
trade-winds, to listen to the daily gossip and to exchange confidences
with those of their companions who may have called to spend the
evening. Here and there one will observe some philandering caballero,
dressed as faultlessly as Beau Brummel, exchanging vows with some
languishing Dulcinea behind the bars. So absorbed are they in each
other that they are totally oblivious of all else in the world, and
utterly unconscious of the attention they attract from the passers-by.
For the time being they themselves are the world and for them
everything else is nonexistent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"

<p>We were sitting one evening in the beautiful plaza of Ciudad
Bolivar, listening to the music of the military band which plays here
several times a week. The &eacute;lite of the city were there.
Beautiful, dark-eyed se&ntilde;oritas, adorned with their graceful
mantillas, were promenading with their fathers and mothers, and gay
young cavaliers were following at a discreet distance, <i lang=
"es">&aacute; la Espa&ntilde;ola</i>. The tropical trees and flowers,
which gave to the plaza the aspect of a botanical garden, were
beautifully illuminated, and, without any effort of the imagination,
one could easily imagine one&rsquo;s self in fairyland. Hard by, a
young lady from Trinidad, on whose finger was a sparkling solitaire,
was recounting, in a more audible tone than she imagined, the pleasures
of her voyage up the Orinoco. In the glow of her enthusiasm she
declared to her confidant, &ldquo;I am going to come to the Orinoco
during my honeymoon. Don Esteban&rdquo;&mdash;evidently her
fianc&eacute;&mdash;&ldquo;will just have to bring me here. I cannot
imagine a more delightful trip anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This young lady, who had traveled extensively, in this inadvertent
publication of her secret but expresses the impression that would be
reiterated, I fancy, by the majority of her sex under the same
circumstances. The Orinoco is, indeed, beautiful, and a sail on its
placid waters, if not &ldquo;the most delightful excursion one could
take,&rdquo; as Miss Trinidad declared, is certainly one of the most
delightful.</p>
<p>The day before we were to return to the Port-of-Spain, while
chatting with a friend on the upper deck of our steamer&mdash;which we
had made our hotel, because the lodging houses of the city were so
poor&mdash;we saw a small vessel coming down stream under a full head
of steam. On inquiry we found it to be a boat from Orocu&eacute;, a
small town in Colombia, on the river Meta. We immediately called upon
the captain of the craft, and, as a result of our interview, determined
to accompany him on his return trip to this distant point.</p>
<p>When we left Trinidad, we had no intention of going <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>further up the river than Ciudad Bolivar, but we
had enjoyed everything so much, that now that an occasion thus so
unexpectedly presented itself, we rejoiced that we should have an
opportunity of seeing more of the great Orinoco, and of sailing on the
waters of its great tributary, the historic Meta.</p>
<p>Dreams of the past began at once to flit before us as possible
realities in the near future. If we once got to Orocu&eacute;, what was
to prevent us from going further up the river&mdash;as far as its
waters were navigable? Then by crossing the llanos of eastern Colombia,
and the Cordilleras of the Andes we would be in far-famed
Bogot&aacute;, the Athens of South America.</p>
<p>We had had, it is true, visions of this trip, but rather as
something greatly to be desired than as even a remote possibility. And
now, in a few moments&mdash;after a brief conversation with the captain
of the boat that had just moored alongside our own, the journey was
decided on, and nothing remained but to make the necessary
preparations.</p>
<p>As, however, the steamer would not be ready to go to Orocu&eacute;
for about two weeks, we concluded to return to the Port-of-Spain and
come back the following week. This would give us an opportunity of
studying more in detail several interesting features of the lower
Orinoco that we had only gotten a glimpse of during the upward trip,
and of seeing by daylight parts of the river that we had before passed
during the night. We would also be able to spend a few more days in the
beautiful island of Trinidad, and feast our eyes on its thousand
beauties which greet one at every turn.</p>
<p>It was, indeed, providential for us that we returned to Trinidad as
we did, for while there&mdash;was it chance or was it our usual good
fortune?&mdash;we found, what above all else we needed in this
juncture&mdash;a good, brave, enthusiastic companion for the long and
arduous trip before us. Our <i>compagnon de voyage</i>, who would
fondly affect the ways and dress of a dapper young caballero, and whom,
therefore, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>we shall call C.&mdash;caballero&mdash;was a
professor of languages. He had traveled extensively, was interested in
the Spanish language and literature and the peoples we were about to
visit. He was, like ourselves, fond of adventure, and was not averse to
its being accompanied by an element of danger. This only gave
additional zest to what were else rather tame and prosaic. Our plans
were soon made, and, before the steamer was ready to return to Ciudad
Bolivar, we were fully equipped with everything necessary for our long
trip across the continent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href=

Elsewhere he tells us of the thousands of &ldquo;vglie serpents,&rdquo;

saw everywhere along the Orinoco. They were what are now known as

are seldom more than six to eight feet long, while the latter are said
sometimes to attain a length of twenty-five feet. We saw several of
them every day but their number was far from being as great as is

Martyr says of them:&mdash;&rdquo;<span lang="la">Edaces humanarum
carnium novi helluones anthropophagi, Caribes alias Canibales
appellati.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">Notwithstanding all that has been said on the
subject since the discovery of America, it is still a moot question
with many serious investigators whether the Caribs of Tierra Firme were
ever cannibals, as is so generally believed. That the Caribs of certain
of the West Indian islands were addicted to anthropophagy there can, it
seems, be little doubt. The concurrent testimony of the earlier
writers, including Peter Martyr and Cardinal Bembo and others, have
apparently placed the matter beyond controversy. It was the cruelties
and anthropophagous habits of the Caribs, as reported to Spain, that
provoked the law which was promulgated in 1504 in virtue of which every
Indian, who could be proved to be of Carib origin, might be enslaved by
the Spaniards. This law, however, although designed by its framers to
eliminate a practice that was a disgrace to humanity, opened the door
to evils almost as great&mdash;if not greater in some
instances&mdash;as those it was expected to suppress. Selfish, soulless
colonists had but to circulate the report that certain Indians, whom
they coveted for slaves, were cannibals, in order to justify themselves
before the law for tearing them from their homes and keeping them in
servitude. Thus it happened that, shortly after the promulgation of the
law aforesaid, the Caribs of the Mainland, as well as those of the West
Indies, were classed as cannibals. They were accordingly hunted like
wild beasts, and countless thousands of them&mdash;the same innocent,
gentle, inoffensive creatures that so strongly appealed to
Columbus&mdash;were sold into slavery and met with a cruel death in the
mines of Espa&ntilde;ola. So successful were the atrocious
slave-dealers of the time in fixing the stigma of cannibal on the
Indians of the Mainland that Herrera felt authorized to declare that
there was in every pueblo of Venezuela a slaughter house in which human
flesh could be obtained&mdash;<i lang="es">en cada Pueblo havia
Caneceria publica de carne humana</i> (Dec. VIII, Lib. II, Cap.
XIX).</p>
<p class="footnote">Direct and specific as is this charge, it is quite
safe to assert that it is utterly devoid of foundation in fact. The
most charitable construction we can put on Herrera&rsquo;s statements
is that he was misled by the false reports of those whose interest it
was to have it believed that the Caribs of Venezuela, as well as those
of the West Indies, indulged in the horrid practice of devouring their
enemies. Humboldt was among the first to raise his voice in defense of
the Indians of the Mainland and to assert that it was only the Caribs
of the West Indies that had &ldquo;rendered the names cannibals,
Caribbees and anthropophagi, synonymous.&rdquo; (<i>Personal
Narrative</i>, Vol. II, p. 414.)</p>
<p class="footnote">A recent Venezuelan writer, Tavera-Acosta, declares
that it is &ldquo;an incontrovertible fact that so far the
anthropophagy of which they have been accused by their ferocious and
ignorant executioners has never been proved&rdquo; against the Caribs.
Their sole crime was that they took arms against their ruthless
invaders in defense of their homes, and relying on their numbers and
conscious superiority over other tribes endeavored by all possible
means to preserve their independence. (<i lang="es">Anales de
Guayana</i>, p. 320, Ciudad Bolivar, 1905.)</p>
<p class="footnote">There can be no doubt that the Indians, during the
period of the conquest and subsequently, were the victims of gross
misrepresentations and had in consequence to endure untold hardships
and miseries. Not content with denouncing them as cannibals, their
relentless persecutors&mdash;Dutch, Germans, English, French and
Portuguese, as well as Spaniards&mdash;insisted on regarding them as
mere animals&mdash;like a species of chimpanzee or
orang-outang&mdash;that had no souls and no rights any one was bound to
respect. It required the bull&mdash;<i>Sublimis Deus</i>&mdash;of Pope
Paul III to define the status of the hapless Indians, to make it clear
that they are not &ldquo;dumb brutes created for our service,&rdquo;
but that they &ldquo;are truly men&rdquo;; that &ldquo;they are by no
means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their
property&rdquo;; that they are not &ldquo;to be in any way
enslaved&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;should the contrary happen, it shall
be null and of no effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">What has been said of the cannibalism of the South
American Indian in times past may with even greater truth be iterated
of it to-day. In spite of what has been written to the contrary, even
by so distinguished an explorer as Rafael Reyes&mdash;ex-president of
Colombia&mdash;it may well be doubted if there is a single tribe in
South America that can justly be accused of cannibalism. Some of them,
owing to their miserable social condition, or because they have for
generations past been the victims of the injustice and cruelty of the
whites, may be ferocious and vindictive, but, that even the worst of
them are cannibals, is yet to be proved. Compare <i>Oviedo y
Ba&ntilde;os</i>, op. cit., II, p. 377 et seq., and <i>Across the South
American Continent, Exploration of the Brothers Reyes, Paper Read at

constellations are ever changing their position with reference to any

distant past, when the Southern Cross was visible in the very land in
which Dante penned his immortal poem. &ldquo;At the time of Claudius
Ptolem&aelig;us,&rdquo; says Humboldt, &ldquo;the beautiful star at the

culminates there several degrees below the horizon.</p>

began to become invisible in 52&deg; 30&prime; north latitude 2900
years before our era, since, according to Galle, this constellation
might previously have reached an altitude of more than 10&deg;. When it
disappeared from the horizon of the countries on the Baltic, the great
pyramid of Cheops had already been erected more than five hundred
years. The pastoral tribe of the Hyksos made their incursion seven
hundred years earlier. The past seems to be visibly nearer to us when

<h2 class="main">IN MID-ORINOQUIA</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At last we were ready to start on our long journey up
the Orinoco and the Meta, and then across the llanos of Eastern
Colombia, and the Cordilleras to far-off Bogot&aacute;. For several
days the swarthy stevedores of Ciudad Bolivar had been busy in
transferring to our little steamer the freight that had here been
accumulating for her during the preceding six months.</p>
<p>For several days, too, our friends and acquaintances had been
endeavoring to dissuade us from what one and all pronounced a rash and
dangerous undertaking. All meant well, but all were prophets of ill. No
one, we were assured, had ever gone to Bogot&aacute; by the route we
purposed taking,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2706src" href="#xd21e2706"
name="xd21e2706src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href=
"#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>and we were solemnly warned time
and again that we were surely risking our health if not exposing our
lives. Everything, it was averred, was against the successful
termination of our journey, and it would be a miracle if we ever
reached Bogot&aacute; alive.</p>
<p>First of all, there were the steaming, miasmatic exhalations in the
Orinoco and Meta valleys, from which they were never free, and the ever
present danger of yellow fever and other malignant diseases. Even
people who were thoroughly acclimated incurred the greatest risk in
traveling through this pestiferous, germ-laden atmosphere. How much
more then should we, who had so recently come from the chilly north, be
exposed, if we still persisted in our foolhardy venture? And then, if
we fell sick, as we surely must, we should be in a trackless
wilderness, among savages, and far away from medical aid of any
kind.</p>
<p>Then there was the torrid climate to take into account. By reason of
the intense heat, it would be impossible to travel by day. We should
then perforce be obliged to travel by night. And this implied new
dangers&mdash;dangers of straying from a poorly defined trail, or of
falling into ravines, or quagmires, and dangers from wild animals of
all kinds, with which the forests and plains were always infested.
There was the jaguar, always prowling about, seeking whom he might
devour; the labairi and boaquira, serpents whose envenomed fangs bring
certain death to their victims, and the dread boa that was pictured as
hanging in untold numbers from the branches of the trees in the forests
through which we should pass.</p>
<p>A torrid climate, a reeky, malarial atmosphere, a region infested
with venomous serpents&mdash;all this was bad enough, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>but
this was far from being the sum total of the pests and plagues we
should encounter.</p>
<p>There was that ever-present pest&mdash;whose name is not legion, but
billion&mdash;on which travelers in South America have exhausted their
supply of adjectives in the vain attempt adequately to express their
sentiments. I refer to what the Spaniard has so aptly called the
<i>plaga</i>&mdash;the plague&mdash;the cloud of mosquitoes of many
species that constantly torment the traveler, and give him no rest
night or day. We had read what various writers on the equinoctial
regions had to say of the murderous onslaughts of the mosquito from the
time of the early missionaries down to our own, and such reading was
far from calculated to reassure one who was about to form a more
intimate acquaintance of the <i>plaga</i> in question.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2753src" href="#xd21e2753" name="xd21e2753src">2</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p>In a work written on the Orinoco in 1822, Mr. J. H. Robertson,
referring to this matter, declares that &ldquo;the biting, blistering,
and intolerable itching&rdquo; which is produced by clouds of
mosquitoes is &ldquo;indeed enough to make a man mad.&rdquo; He says
that they made the passengers&mdash;blacks as well as others, that were
on the boat with him, &ldquo;almost roar with agony,&rdquo; and that in
the morning the &ldquo;whole body exhibited one mass of small blisters
from millions of bites we had received during the
night.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2806src" href="#xd21e2806"
name="xd21e2806src">3</a></p>
<p>In a more recent book, by another Englishman, it is stated that the
Orinoco is the &ldquo;paradise of mosquitoes, and the hell of
travelers. There, insects of unusual size, and speckled in an ominous
and snake-like manner, issued from the bush in millions and assailed
every square inch of the exposed skin.... Moreover, they stung through
the boots, coat and waistcoat, and drew blood wherever they
penetrated.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2813src" href=
"#xd21e2813" name="xd21e2813src">4</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>On looking over these works again, we found that the miseries
referred to were endured chiefly in the delta of the Orinoco, and not
so much in the river above. Yet, strange to say, our experience, so far
at least, was the very contrary of all this, although we had passed
through the delta three times. On none of these occasions had we ever
been molested by a single mosquito or had we ever thought of using a
mosquito net. As a matter of fact, nobody ever used such a protection
against insects, as there was no call for it. Our natural inference was
that the reports about this <i>plaga</i> of the Orinoco were much
exaggerated, and we had reason to suspect that the same was true about
the terrific heat against which we had so repeatedly been warned.</p>
<p>We had been twice in La Guaira, which Humboldt declared to be one of
the hottest places on earth, and had not suffered so much from the
elevated temperature there as we had frequently suffered from the
sweltering heat that so often oppresses one in New York and Washington.
We remembered, too, that another German writer had characterized Ciudad
Bolivar, on account of the intensity <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>of the heat
prevailing there, as &ldquo;the exit of hell, as La Guaira is its
entrance.&rdquo; And yet during our sojourn of nearly two weeks in the
Orinoco city, we never experienced the slightest discomfort from the
temperature, nor did the thermometer ever rise within ten degrees of
the temperature often registered in some of our North Atlantic coast
cities during the months of July and August.</p>
<p>The truth was, we were beginning to grow quite sceptical about the
much vaunted dangers of equatorial travel. From our experience in
traveling in other lands, we had learned how prone the majority of
those who do not travel are to exaggerate&mdash;unconsciously,
perhaps&mdash;dangers with which they have no personal acquaintance,
and how inclined certain travelers are to magnify slight discomforts
and trifling occurrences into dangerous and trying adventures,
especially when their imaginary deeds of prowess are performed in
countries rarely visited, and, therefore, beyond the control of a
truthful recorder.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2844src" href=
"#xd21e2844" name="xd21e2844src">5</a></p>
<p>The little heed we gave to all the dire predictions that had been so
freely volunteered and our persistence in going forward on our journey,
as we had planned it, evidently led one of our friends to suspect our
scepticism, and he accordingly resorted to what he honestly believed to
be conclusive evidence of the futility of our purpose and the danger of
our undertaking. This was an article that had recently been published
in an English magazine which had just reached Ciudad Bolivar. The
article was entitled, <i>Adventures on the Orinoco</i>, and contained
the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For many reasons the Orinoco is one of the most dangerous
rivers in the world. Not only are there countless physical dangers in
the shape of sunken rocks, wrecks and tree trunks, huge sand banks,
ever-changing channels and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>bewildering currents, but also
many living, though often hidden, perils in the form of man, beast or
reptile. The higher one ascends, and the farther one penetrates beyond
the Maipures rapids into the heart of the Alto Orinoco, the wilder the
scene, and the more perilous the river. Sparsely populated as is the
vast region above and immediately below the rapids, it is often the
home of anarchy and misrule, and always a domain where the passions of
men know not the restraints of law, and civilization is still a
dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To clinch his argument, our friend assured us that the Meta
region&mdash;whither we were bound&mdash;was far worse than that of the
Upper Orinoco. The banks of the Meta were always infested by hordes of
savage Guahibos, the terror of eastern Colombia. Hiding in the dense
underbrush that skirts the river, the first indication of their
presence would be a shower of well-directed, poisoned arrows against
the daring intruder into their jealously guarded domains. Only a few
months before, a steamer like ours had been attacked near the mouth of
the Meta by several hundred Indians and outlaws, and we were exposed to
a similar assault from the same quarter, unless we would listen to
reason, and desist from our hazardous and reckless enterprise.
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; he added finally, &ldquo;it is by no means
certain that your boat will be permitted to reach its destination. As
you know, the government is now engaged in quelling the revolution led
by one Pe&ntilde;alosa. Only a few days ago a large steamer was
dispatched to San Fernando, laden with arms and ammunition, and orders
have been issued for your boat to call at Caicara and Urbana and be
subject to the orders of the army officers there awaiting instructions
from the scene of war. If the steamer shall be needed by the
government, as now seems more than probable, you will be left wherever
the boat happens to be commandeered, and then you will have no means of
returning hither except in a dugout, if you are fortunate enough to
find one. To continue your course up the river in an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>Indian canoe, at this season of the year, at the
beginning of the rainy season, is, of course, impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were not frightened by the thought of meeting the Indians. We had
met them before in many places, and had never found them so dangerous
as depicted. The thought, however, of being put ashore, in case the
government should need our boat, and of being compelled to make our way
back to Ciudad Bolivar in an Indian dugout was something that caused us
to ponder, but not to hesitate. We had been in similar quandaries
before, and, relying on our good luck, which has never failed us in our
wanderings, we determined to take our chances. We had faith in our
star, and we instinctively felt, in spite of the untoward outlook, that
we should in due course arrive safe and sound at Orocu&eacute;. We
recalled and were encouraged by Minerva&rsquo;s words to
Ulysses:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Finally, long after the hour scheduled for our
departure from Ciudad Bolivar, our boat slipped her moorings, and she
was soon out in mid-river with her prow directed toward the setting
sun. It was the last week in April and the rainy season had already set
in&mdash;much earlier than usual. The river had been rising rapidly for
several days, and we, therefore, had no reason to apprehend danger on
the score of shallow water. The usual time for the opening of
navigation to the Upper Meta was anticipated by more than a month. This
was a favorable omen to begin with. By starting thus in advance of the
usual time we should be able to reach the river Magdalena before its
high waters would begin to subside. This was of prime importance to us,
as it would enable us to escape those long and embarrassing delays that
are so frequently occasioned in this river during the dry season.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span></p>
<p>The word season has been frequently used in these pages, but,
strictly speaking, there are in the tropics no such things as seasons
as we know them in higher latitudes. In the equatorial regions it is
always summer and verdure and bloom are perennial. For the sake of
convenience the natives speak of two seasons, the rainy season, known
as winter, and the dry season which is called summer. The winter season
in the valleys of the Orinoco and the Meta begins about the first of
May and lasts until October. The remaining months, constituting the
winter and a part of the spring of regions farther north, is known as
summer.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s account of the seasons in these parts is
so pertinent and so accurate in the main that I give it in his own
words. &ldquo;The winter and the summer,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;<span lang="en-1600">as touching cold and heate differ not,
neither do the trees euer, senciblie lose the leaues, but haue alwaies
fruite either ripe or green at one time: But their winter onelie
consisteth of terrible raynes, and ouerflowings of the riuers, with
many great storms and gusts, thunder, and lightnings, of which we had
our fill, ere we returned.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2906src" href="#xd21e2906" name="xd21e2906src">7</a></p>
<p>Our boat was a double-deck stern-wheeler of very light
draft&mdash;about two feet&mdash;and capable of carrying about fifty
tons. Her chief cargo was salt, groceries and dry-goods, most of which
was destined for Orocu&eacute;.</p>
<p>Outside of the crew there were but few passengers&mdash;not more
than eight or ten all told. Among the most congenial were a Colombian
from Bogot&aacute;, and a young German, who was traveling in the
interest of a large commercial house in Ciudad Bolivar. The crew was a
motley one. The majority of them were Venezuelan mestizos. Besides
these, there were three or four West Indian negroes, and six or seven
full-blooded Indians from the Upper Meta. The latter had come down the
river only a few days previously and were now returning with us to
their homes. They had been engaged to perform some menial services
aboard, for which they received a trifling compensation. They all
belonged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>to the ferocious tribe of Guahibos, about whom
we had heard such frightful stories, but these particular members of
the tribe we found to be very quiet and harmless. One of them spoke
Spanish fairly well, and through him we were able to learn much about
the manners and customs of his tribe. He was quite intelligent and took
pleasure in telling us about the mode of life and occupations of his
people. Later on, especially in Orocu&eacute;, where we spent ten days,
we were able to verify his statements. All his companions aboard,
although below the average height, were broad-shouldered, well-formed,
and possessed of extraordinary strength and endurance. Judging from the
work we saw them do, we were not surprised to learn that they are
considered among the best warriors among the savage tribes in this part
of South America.</p>
<p>The first place of any special interest on the Orinoco above Ciudad
Bolivar is what is known as <i lang="es">La Puerta del
Infierno</i>&mdash;The Gate of Hell. It is nothing more than a
contraction of the river where the current is unusually strong, and
where, on account of the large rocks in the river bed, there are
numerous eddies and whirlpools. From what we had been told, the passage
at this point was more difficult and dangerous than shooting the rapids
of the St. Lawrence, and the scenery was represented as grand beyond
description. The scenery was wild and interesting, but far from sublime
or awe-inspiring. The current, it is true, was quite rapid, and our
little craft made but slow progress through the surging, seething
waters, but there was never any danger. For small sloops or schooners,
and especially for <i lang="es">curiaras</i>, or dugouts, the passage
would doubtless be difficult and somewhat perilous. It is, however,
important that the pilot and helmsman should exercise considerable care
so as to avoid striking the massive rocks with which the bed of the
river is so thickly studded.</p>
<p>Considering the fertility of the soil, and the splendid grazing
lands on the north bank of the Orinoco, one is surprised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>at
the sparseness of the population. It is only at long intervals that one
sees any signs of human habitations, and then they are of the most
primitive character. Mapire and Las Bonitas are two straggling villages
whose inhabitants are chiefly engaged in stock-raising. The latter
place was also at one time the centre of the tonka bean industry, but
most of this trade has been transferred to Ciudad Bolivar.</p>
<p>Of the people of Las Bonitas, the noted explorer Crevaux writes as
follows: &ldquo;Every man here has a cabin, a mandolin, a hammock, a
gun, a wife and the fever. These constitute all his
wants.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2930src" href="#xd21e2930"
name="xd21e2930src">8</a></p>
<p>Near the confluence of the Apure with the Orinoco is the town of
Caicara, with a population of six or seven hundred souls. It is
something of a distributing centre for this section of the country.
Besides stock-raising and agriculture, which receive considerable
attention here, there is quite a trade carried on with the Indians of
the interior, who bring into the town certain much valued articles of
commerce. Among these are hammocks, made from the leaf of the moriche
palm, and ropes made from the fibres of a palm called by the natives
<i lang="es">chichique</i>&mdash;<i>attalea funifera</i>&mdash;which
are highly prized for their strength, durability, and above all, on
account of their being less affected by water and moisture than ropes
made from other materials. Large quantities of sarrapia or tonka beans
are brought here from the neighboring forests. They are much esteemed
as an ingredient of certain perfumes and for flavoring tobacco.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span></p>
<p>The town has a splendid location, and under a stable and
enterprising government would be the centre of a large inland trade.
Towering about a hundred and fifty feet above the town is a hill of
gneissic granite, on the summit of which are the ruins of a Capuchin
monastery, which has been abandoned since the War of Independence.</p>
<p>Our party was here augmented by a Venezuelan hide and cattle
merchant. He was a sociable fellow, and reminded us very much of a
Colorado or New Mexican cowboy. He left us at Urbana, the last town of
any importance, between Caicara and Orocu&eacute;.</p>
<p>We arrived at Urbana, a town of about the same size and importance
as Caicara, shortly after six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and were
surprised that there was no one at the landing place to meet us. At
every other place at which we had stopped, every man, woman and child
was out to see us. It is only five or six times a year that a steamer
calls at this place, and then only during the rainy season, when the
river is high. The place was as silent as the grave, and seemed
absolutely deserted. There was not even a dog bark to break the
oppressive stillness, and not a single light was to be seen in house or
street. On enquiry we were informed that everybody had retired for the
night. The sun had just set only a few minutes before, but like the
domestic fowl in the back yard, all the denizens of the town had sought
rest with the approach of darkness, and, under ordinary circumstances,
would not have been seen before dawn the next day. This custom
impressed us at first as being very extraordinary, but we afterwards
learned that it is not unusual in small interior South American towns.
In fact, we soon found ourselves imitating the example of the natives.
Shortly after sunset&mdash;there is scarcely any twilight in this
latitude&mdash;we sought our berth or our hammock, and rarely awoke
before the caroling of the birds announced the break of another day. Of
course, we often had a special reason for retiring as early as we did.
A lighted lamp, especially on the Orinoco and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>Meta, became at once the centre of attraction
for a cloud of insects of all kinds&mdash;some of which emitted a most
offensive odor. But aside from this we soon became quite accustomed to
early slumbers. The ever warm climate seems to predispose to sleep,
and, even after a good night&rsquo;s rest, one would welcome an
hour&rsquo;s siesta after luncheon.</p>
<p>After the steamer whistle had blown several times, and set all the
dogs in town to barking, the male population was aroused and came
straggling one by one to where we were moored. We were in need of a new
supply of provisions, as what we had brought from Ciudad Bolivar was
almost exhausted. After making the round of the town, our steward was
able, but not without difficulty, to get some eggs, chickens, and a
<i>novilla</i>&mdash;heifer. This would last us a few days, at the
expiration of which we hoped to find a new supply further up the
river.</p>
<p>Much, however, as we were concerned about our commissariat, our
interest was just then centered in the result of a confidential
interview in progress between the captain and an army officer, who was
to decide whether we should be permitted to proceed on our journey, or
whether our boat should be appropriated for use in the campaign against
the revolutionists, who were said to be heading towards the llanos of
the Apure. This contingency had, like the sword of Damocles, been
hanging over us ever since we left Ciudad Bolivar. Only a few days
before, we had met a steamer returning from San Fernando de Apure,
whither it had been dispatched with arms and ammunition, and there were
grave reasons, so we were informed, for believing that we should be
obliged to disembark at Urbana. If we could only reach Orocu&eacute;,
we had every reasonable hope of making the remainder of our
transcontinental journey without any special difficulty or danger. If,
however, the steamer were now required for military service, we should
be obliged to remain in Urbana for an indefinite period, and
perhaps&mdash;the thought was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>almost maddening&mdash;be
forced to abandon entirely an enterprise on which we had so set our
hearts.</p>
<p>The suspense, which did not last more than a
half-hour&mdash;although it seemed a whole day&mdash;was finally
relieved by the joyful announcement that we should be permitted to
continue our journey to Orocu&eacute;. No one who lives in a country
like ours can realize what good news this was to all of us. In the
United States, if we miss a train, we can get another a few hours
later. There, on the contrary, far off in the wilderness, where the
means of communication are so rare, the permission to proceed was like
the commutation of a sentence for a long term of imprisonment into the
granting of immediate liberty.</p>
<p>After this happy decision had been conveyed to us, we wished to
start without a moment&rsquo;s delay. Hitherto, thanks to the bright
moonlight with which we had been favored, we had been able to travel
night and day. Now, for the first time, the sky became clouded, and we
were obliged, as a precautionary measure, to remain where we were,
until the clouds disappeared. To attempt to navigate the river in these
parts, where the channel is ever changing, where there are so many sand
bars, and so many floating trees and obstructions of all kinds, would
be extremely dangerous, and might mean the wrecking of our vessel when
we least expected it. Fortunately, the clouds soon passed by, and we
were again on our way rejoicing, and rejoicing as only those can
realize who have been placed in circumstances similar to ours at that
critical juncture.</p>
<p>The scenery along the Orinoco between Ciudad Bolivar and Urbana is
quite different from that of the delta. There we have one of
Nature&rsquo;s hothouses on an immense scale, with a luxuriance of
vegetation that is not surpassed in any part of the known world.
Further up the river there is less variety and richness, and the trees
are smaller and fewer in number. One soon observes, also, a marked
contrast between the vegetation on the right as compared with that on
the left bank. On the right bank the forest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>land
still continues, while on the left bank, for the greater part of the
distance, we have the llanos or plains&mdash;for many reasons so
celebrated in Venezuelan annals. On both sides the land is
comparatively low and flat, although here and there, especially on the
right bank, there are highlands, and occasionally, when the forest
fringing the river permits it, one can see hills and mountains towards
the south.</p>
<p>The part of Venezuela south of the Orinoco&mdash;known as Venezuelan
Guiana&mdash;is still practically an unknown land. Humboldt, Michelena
y Rojas, Schomburgk, and others, it is true, have explored portions of
the upper Orinoco and some of the tributaries, but the impenetrable
forest lands through which these rivers pass are still quite
unknown.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2992src" href="#xd21e2992" name=
"xd21e2992src">9</a> As to the territory north of the Orinoco and the
Arauca it has been quite well known since the times of the early
mission period of Venezuela. Much of it, indeed, was explored by the
conquistadores.</p>
<p>The llanos extend southward from the mountain range bordering the
Caribbean to the Orinoco and its great tributary, the Meta. They have
an area more than four times as great as that of the state of New York
and are, in many respects, the most valuable lands of this part of
tropical America. And strange as it may appear, they are the most
neglected and most undeveloped. Their population and products are less
than they were in the days of the early <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>missionaries, and,
from present indications, there is little probability that there shall
soon be any change for the better. Everywhere are immense savannas, in
which are numerous clumps of trees and groves, swamps and lagoons, all
teeming with multitudinous forms of animal life. Here&mdash;especially
along the Apure&mdash;bird-life is particularly conspicuous. It is here
that occur the most extensive <i>garceros</i> in Venezuela, if not in
South America, and it is here that the annual slaughter of the egret is
greatest.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of square miles of the llanos are inundated during
the rainy season. Then certain parts of the country present the
appearance of immense inland seas. The rivers overflow their banks, and
the floods rise almost to the tree tops of the nearly submerged forest.
The landscape then is not unlike what it must have been during the
Carboniferous Period&mdash;immense stretches of dense, luxuriant
woodlands in a vast fresh-water sea. It is then that it seems &ldquo;an
unfinished country, the mountains not yet having lent enough material
to the llanos to keep them out of water during the entire
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For centuries past the llanos have been famous for their immense
herds of cattle and horses. It is said that Gen. Crespo, one of the
presidents of Venezuela, had no fewer than two hundred and fifty
thousand cattle<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3012src" href="#xd21e3012"
name="xd21e3012src">10</a> on his <i>hatos</i>&mdash;ranches&mdash;and
we were told of an old bachelor who now has a <i>hato</i> that counts a
hundred thousand head of cattle, not to speak of an immense number of
horses.</p>
<p>During the War of Independence the wild horses and cattle were in
some parts &ldquo;so numerous as literally to render it necessary for a
party of cavalry to precede an army on the march, for the purpose of
clearing the way for the infantry and guns.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3023src" href="#xd21e3023" name="xd21e3023src">11</a> And only
a few decades ago, we were assured, the number of cattle was so great
that they were slaughtered for their hides alone. During <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>recent years, however, owing to the number of
revolutions, and the little encouragement afforded by the government to
stock raisers, the herds on the llanos have greatly dwindled in size
and number.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3030src" href="#xd21e3030" name=
"xd21e3030src">12</a></p>
<p>Under favorable conditions they could with ease greatly be
multiplied, and be made to contribute materially to the world&rsquo;s
beef supply. The unlimited pampas, with their rich, succulent grasses,
ten to twelve feet high, are capable of supporting millions of cattle,
and there is no reason why they should not be made available for the
European and North American markets at much lower prices than the beef
that is shipped from Argentina and Australia. Specially constructed
cattle boats, of light draft, could be made to ply the Orinoco, the
Apure, the Arauca and the Meta at all seasons of the year. Under a
settled and progressive government the grazing industry should be the
chief source of revenue of the Venezuelan republic. But, as conditions
now are, cattle raising is in a most deplorable state. When we asked
the Llaneros&mdash;people of the plains&mdash;along the Orinoco and the
Meta why they did not have larger herds on their magnificent savannas,
they invariably replied: &ldquo;What is the use? We get a large herd,
and then there is a revolution. The army comes along and appropriates
our cattle, and we never get a penny for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During our trip up the Orinoco we tried at a
<i>conuco</i>&mdash;small farm&mdash;to purchase some chickens, but
were told by the proprietor that, although he usually had large numbers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>for sale, he did not then have a single one
left. &ldquo;I heard yesterday that the revolutionists were coming this
way&rdquo;&mdash;he had heard of the Pe&ntilde;alosa
outbreak&mdash;&ldquo;and I at once killed all my chickens and gave my
family and friends a great chicken feast. If the soldiers had come they
would have taken all and would not have given me anything for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are no better horsemen in the world than the Llaneros of
Venezuela and Colombia. They have often been called the Cossacks of
South America, and the name is not undeserved. In daring feats of
horsemanship their only rivals are the cowboys of our western plains,
and the intrepid Gauchos of the pampas of Argentina.</p>
<p>And no one has a greater love for horses than has the Llanero. Like
the Arab, he would rather part with his most cherished possessions than
dispose of a favorite steed. For one who has met this modern Centaur,
or who is familiar with his mode of life, the reason is evident. As the
Llanero spends the greater part of his life on horseback, his faithful
charger is to him, as to the Arab, not only a companion, but his
dearest and most reliable friend. Hence one need not be surprised to
hear him exclaim in the words of a llano bard:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mi mujer y mi caballo</p>
<p class="line">Se murieron a un tiempo;</p>
<p class="line">Que mujer, ni que demonio,</p>

id="xd21e3062src" href="#xd21e3062" name="xd21e3062src">13</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;All his actions and exertions,&rdquo; declares
P&aacute;ez, &ldquo;must be assisted by his horse; for him the noblest
effort of man is when, gliding swiftly over the boundless plains and
bending over his spirited charger, he overturns an enemy or masters a
wild bull.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130"
name="pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like the character described by Victor Hugo, &ldquo;He would not
fight except on horseback. He forms but one person with his horse. He
lives on horseback; trades, buys and sells on horseback; eats, drinks,
sleeps and dreams on horseback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Give the Llanero a horse, and the equipment of a lance and a gun, a
poncho and a hammock, and he is independent. With these he is at home
wherever the setting sun may happen to find him. The hammock serves him
for a bed, and the poncho for a protection against sun and rain, while
with his lance and gun he can easily secure the food he may require.
Having these things, he is happy, and although he may be poor in all
other worldly goods, he is ever ready merrily to sing</p>

<p class="first">It was the Llaneros who during the war with Spain
contributed so much towards achieving the independence of both
Venezuela and New Granada. Under their leader, P&aacute;ez, they
allowed the Spanish army no peace day or night. Armed with their long
lances, they seemed to be ubiquitous and pursued their enemies with
unrelenting fury. And the novelty of their methods of warfare&mdash;an
anticipation of those so successfully employed by the Boers in their
recent war with England&mdash;were such as quite to disconcert those
who rigidly adhered to the tactics in vogue in Europe. On one occasion
P&aacute;ez dislodged a large detachment of Spaniards by driving wild
cattle against them, and then, burning the grass by which they were
surrounded, utterly destroyed all of them. How like De Wett&rsquo;s
methods in the Transvaal!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3098src" href=
"#xd21e3098" name="xd21e3098src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>On another occasion it was necessary for Bolivar&rsquo;s army to
cross the Apure, near San Fernando, in order to engage Morillo, whose
headquarters were then at Calabozo. But Bolivar had no boats, and the
Apure at this point was wide and deep. Besides, the Spanish flotilla
was guarding the river at the point opposite to which the patriot
forces were marching. Bolivar was in despair. Turning to P&aacute;ez,
he said, &ldquo;I would give the world to have possession of the
Spanish flotilla, for without it I can never cross the river, and the
troops are unable to march.&rdquo; &ldquo;It shall be yours in an
hour,&rdquo; replied P&aacute;ez. Selecting three hundred of his
Llanero lancers, all distinguished for strength and bravery, he said,
pointing to the gun-boats, &ldquo;We must have these <i>flecheras</i>
or die. Let those follow Tio<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3115src" href=
"#xd21e3115" name="xd21e3115src">16</a> who please.&rdquo; And at the
same moment, spurring his horse, he dashed into the river and swam
towards the flotilla. The guard followed him with their lances in their
hands, now encouraging their horses to bear up against the current by
swimming by their sides and patting their necks, and shouting to scare
away the crocodiles, of which there were hundreds in the river, till
they reached the boats, when mounting their horses, they sprang from
their backs on board them, headed by their leader, and to the
astonishment of those who beheld them from the shore, captured every
one of them. To English officers it may appear inconceivable that a
body of cavalry with no other arms than their lances, and no other mode
of conveyance across a rapid river than their horses, should attack and
take a fleet of gun-boats amidst shoals of alligators; but strange as
it may seem, it was actually accomplished, and there are many officers
now in England who can testify to the truth of it.<a id="xd21e3118"

<p>The islands between Urbana and the cataracts of Atures have long
been famous for the number of turtles that annually <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>congregate on them. During the dry season they
come to these islands by hundreds of thousands, and deposit their eggs
in the <i>playas</i>, or sand banks, which are here quite extensive. So
great is their number, says Padre Gumilla, that &ldquo;It would be as
difficult to count the grains of sand on the shores of the Orinoco as
to count the immense numbers of turtles that inhabit its margins and
waters. Were it not for the vast consumption of turtles and their eggs,
the river Orinoco, despite its great magnitude, would be unnavigable,
for vessels would be impeded by the enormous multitude of the
turtles.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3131src" href="#xd21e3131"
name="xd21e3131src">18</a></p>
<p>Humboldt estimated the number which, in his time, annually deposited
their eggs on the banks of the middle Orinoco to be nearly a million.
Owing to the abandonment of the system of collecting the eggs, that
prevailed in the time of the missionaries, the number of turtles is not
now so great as formerly. The amount of oil, however, that is still
prepared from turtle eggs, is sufficient to constitute quite an
important article of commerce. The time of the <i>Cosecha</i>&mdash;egg
harvest&mdash;always brings together a large crowd of Indians of
various tribes, besides a number of <i>pulperos</i>&mdash;small
traders&mdash;from Urbana and Ciudad Bolivar.</p>
<p>To our great disappointment, we arrived a few days too late for the
harvest. We were able to see no more than a few belated turtles here
and there and the abandoned palm-leaf huts that served to protect the
Indians from the sun during their temporary residence on these sand
banks which have been the favorite resorts of countless turtles from
time immemorial. Our steward was fortunate enough to get a large fine
turtle, weighing fully fifty pounds, and we had turtle steak and turtle
soup that would delight the most confirmed epicure. Our <i>chef</i>, we
may add in this connection, took pride in his work, and his skill and
attention contributed not a little to the pleasure of our
fortnight&rsquo;s voyage on the little steamer which he served so well.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=

<p>A matter of ever-increasing astonishment to us was the continued
great width of the Orinoco, after we had passed such immense
tributaries as the Caroni, the Caura, the Apure, and the Arauca. Near
Urbana, six hundred miles from its mouth, it has a breadth of more than
three miles. This peculiar feature of the great river has attracted the
attention of travelers from the earliest times.</p>
<p>Padre Gilli, a learned missionary, who spent more than eighteen
years in the Orinoco region, thus writes of the great river in his
informing <i lang="it">Saggio de Storia Americana</i>, &ldquo;One
cannot understand how the external appearance of the Orinoco remains
practically uniform, except near its source, whether the waters of
other rivers are or are not added to it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3158src" href="#xd21e3158" name="xd21e3158src">19</a> Depons
tells us that the inhabitants attribute to the waters of the Orinoco
&ldquo;many medical virtues, and affirm that they possess the power of
dispelling wens and such like tumors.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3161src" href="#xd21e3161" name="xd21e3161src">20</a> As for
ourselves, we made no experiments in this direction. We found the water
so muddy from the delta to the Meta, that if a tumbler full of it were
set aside for a while, the bottom of the glass became covered with
quite a thick layer of yellow sediment. We did not find it to possess
the offensive, disgusting odor, due to dead crocodiles, turtles and
manatees of which many travelers have complained, but we did take good
care never to drink any of it without having it carefully filtered.</p>
<p>On leaving Ciudad Bolivar we had a limited supply of ice in a small
refrigerator. This was a real luxury while it lasted. At first we
thought it would be difficult to become accustomed to drinking the warm
water of the river&mdash;it had a temperature of 82&deg; F.&mdash;but
we soon became quite used to it, and rarely, if ever, thought of the
absence of ice.</p>
<p>We had spent nearly two months in Venezuela and were about to enter
the neighboring republic of Colombia. During that period we had visited
most of the chief cities <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>of the coast and of the interior,
and had come into contact with all classes of people. We had talked
with them about matters religious, educational, social, economic,
political, and only rarely did they manifest any disinclination to
express their honest opinions about men and things. Apart from a
certain class of professional revolutionists&mdash;who have everything
to gain and nothing to lose from internecine strife&mdash;we found that
the great majority of the population is, in spite of what has been said
to the contrary, peace-loving and thoroughly sick of the turmoil of
which they have so long been the helpless victims. The better
element&mdash;old Venezuelan families of Spanish descent&mdash;which
should be the ruling element, but which is too often kept in the
background by ambitious adventurers and unscrupulous spoilsmen, have
lofty ideals for their country, and long to see it become the home of
peace and industry, of progress and culture.</p>
<p>For few, if for any of the countries of South America, has Nature
done more than for Venezuela.</p>
<p>She has in the first place the dominating advantage of location. She
is nearer to Europe and the United States than any of the other South
American republics, and should, under a strong and stable government,
enjoy corresponding trade advantages. From her numerous ports on the
Caribbean sea, as well as from points on the Orinoco and its affluents,
freight can be transferred in a few days to our ports on the Gulf and
Atlantic coast, while from La Guaira to Cadiz the distance is but
little greater than it is from New York to London.</p>
<p>And what a great commercial future there is for this at present
hapless and neglected country when it shall be blessed by wise and
progressive rulers! It has soil of marvelous fertility and possesses
mineral deposits of all kinds and of untold value. It has tens of
thousands of square miles of the best grazing land in the world,
capable of supporting millions of cattle. In the lowlands all the
productions of the tropics are found and their annual yield
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>could be enormously increased. In the plateaus
of the mountain chains are produced the fruits and cereals of the
temperate zone&mdash;of the best quality and in surprising abundance.
Then there are the rare and beautiful woods of its interminable virgin
forests; sources of wealth yet untouched and all but unknown, except to
the few who have explored this land of marvelous natural resources.</p>
<p>Such are some of Nature&rsquo;s gifts to Venezuela. But the extent
of her bounty is as astonishing as its variety. How few are there who
have an adequate conception of the extent of this country? It is a land
that is scarcely known to the general reader except in connection with
one of its periodic revolutions. And yet it has an area almost seven
times as great as that of Great Britain and nearly ten times as great
as that of the whole of New England. In extent of territory it equals
France, Germany and Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, Ireland and
Switzerland all combined.</p>
<p>And yet, incredible as it may appear, its total population,
including Indians&mdash;savage as well as civilized&mdash;is less than
that of New York City. If the population of Venezuela were as dense as
that of Belgium the country would count three hundred and fifty-eight
million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Sparse as is the population, it is rather a matter of surprise that
the number of inhabitants is so great rather than that it is so small.
During a period of seventy years there have been no fewer than
seventy-six revolutions. During sixty of these years the country has
seen two armies almost continually in the field. The poor soldiers,
mere puppets of soulless adventurers, rarely knew what they were
fighting for. Against their will, they were torn from their homes and
families to enable ambitious leaders to get control of the government.
The death-rate has been appalling&mdash;at times greater by far than
the birth-rate. Some of the revolutions, it is estimated, have caused
the loss of more than a hundred thousand lives. For this reason, there
has been a decrease in the population during <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>the
last fifty years instead of an increase. Indeed, it may be questioned
whether there are as many inhabitants in the country to-day as there
were before the war with Spain, or even at the time it was first
visited by Europeans.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to name another country, except possibly
Haiti, where, in proportion to the population, war has wrought greater
ravages and counted more victims. A country that should be a land of
peace and plenty has for generations been an armed camp of contending
factions, in which the worst elements have come to the front and in
which justice and innocence and respectability have been trampled under
foot. With all this were the usual concomitants of such a condition of
affairs&mdash;atrocities that the pen would fail to describe, deaths
from famine and pestilence, deaths from the machete and from
imprisonment in dark and foul dungeons.</p>
<p>Like northern Italy, after the death of Frederick II, Venezuela, in
the words of Dante, has been for nearly a century</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e1563">&ldquo;Full</p>
<p class="line">Of tyrants, and the veriest peasant lad</p>

</div>
<p class="first">And there was the consequent stagnation of business
and paralysis of industry of every kind, and the destruction of
property on a scale that seems incredible. Such has been the fate of
Venezuela since the time of Bolivar, whom its people hail as the
Liberator, as the Washington of South America.</p>
<p>But pitiful as has been the country&rsquo;s lot, unfortunate as it
is to-day, the future is not without hope. Only one thing is necessary
to change the present lamentable condition of affairs, and convert
Venezuela into a great and happy country. That one thing is a
man&mdash;a ruler of strong arm and stout heart, who is a patriot in
deed as well as in name; a president who, forgetful of self, will
devote himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>entirely to the development of the
country&rsquo;s resources and to the happiness of his people; a
statesman, who will be intelligent enough and forceful enough to bring
order out of chaos, and give to a long-suffering people those blessings
of civilization which, for generations past, they have known only by
name.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3209src" href="#xd21e3209" name=
"xd21e3209src">22</a></p>
<p>The task is difficult, very difficult, but it is not impossible. It
is only a few decades ago since Mexico was as turbulent a country and
as noted for <i lang="es">pronunciamentos</i> and revolutions as
Venezuela is to-day. Lawlessness was rampant, credit was gone, commerce
languished and the only railroad was a short one extending from Vera
Cruz to the national capital. Within a single generation this has been
all changed, and through the efforts of one man&mdash;Porfirio Diaz.
Under his wise and beneficent guidance, Mexico has emerged from that
state of confusion and anarchy from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>which she had so long
suffered, and now occupies an honored position among the nations of the
world. Give Venezuela a statesman and a patriot of the stamp of Garcia
Moreno or of Diaz, or of our own Roosevelt, and she, too, from being a
comparative waste, will be made to bloom as the rose, and, from being a
byword among the peoples of the earth, will be enabled to attain to
that commercial and economic eminence which is hers by nature and
manifest destiny. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"

P&eacute;rez Triana, the son of a former president of Colombia, was in
1893 obliged to flee from his country, and as the seaports were watched
he and his companions were forced to escape by way of the Meta and the
Orinoco. He tells us in his charming book, <i lang="la">De
Bogot&aacute; al Atlantico</i>, p. 3, of the dread inspired by the
thought of &ldquo;<i lang="la">lo incierto del viaje, que emprendiamos
hacia regiones desconocidas, acaso nunca holladas par la planta del
hombre civilizado</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;the uncertainty of the journey we
were undertaking to unknown regions, probably never trod by the foot of
civilized man.&rdquo;&mdash;<i lang="la">Segunda Edici&oacute;n</i>,
Madrid, 1905.</p>
<p class="footnote">Mr. Cunninghame Graham, in his introduction to this
book, remarks that &ldquo;The voyage in itself was memorable because,
since the first conquerors went down the river with the faith that in
their case, if rightly used, might have smoothed out all the mountain
ranges in the world, no one, except a stray adventurer, or india-rubber
trader, has followed in their footsteps,&rdquo; p. 13, English edition,
London, 1902.</p>
<p class="footnote">Another Colombian, Sr. Modesto Garces, had made the
same journey eight years before, a record of which he has given us in
his little work, <i lang="es">Un viaje &aacute; Venezuela,
Bogot&aacute;</i>, 1890. But neither he nor Sir P&eacute;rez Triana saw
the lower Meta, for they left this river a short distance above
Orocu&eacute;, and voyaged to the Orinoco by way of the Vichada.</p>
<p class="footnote">Three years subsequently to P&eacute;rez
Triana&rsquo;s trip the same journey, with slight modifications, was
made by a German naturalist, Dr. Otto B&uuml;rger. He has given us a
record of it in his <i lang="de">Reisen eines Naturforschers im
Tropischen America</i>, Leipzig, 1900.</p>
<p class="footnote">So far as I am aware, no writer has made the
journey up the river from Ciudad Bolivar to Bogot&aacute;. In a certain
limited sense it was, therefore, probably true that we were the first
to undertake the journey described in the following
pages.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e2706src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2753" href="#xd21e2753src" name="xd21e2753">2</a></span> The
<i>plaga</i>, as understood by the natives, has special reference to
the insects known to them as <i>mosquitoes</i>, <i>zancudos</i> and
<i>jejenes</i>. What they call mosquitoes we call gnats. The zancudo is
our mosquito. The jejen is a small fly whose bite is quite as painful
as that of the zancudo. Sometimes the term zancudo is applied to all
these pests indiscriminately.</p>
<p class="footnote">Besides these insects, that are often the cause of
much suffering to the traveler in low woodlands, there are others that
are sometimes included under the general designation of the
<i>plaga</i>. These are a very small red insect known as the
<i>coloradito</i>, and the <i>nigua</i>, or jigger&mdash;<i>pulex
penetrans</i>&mdash;which, on account of the misery they occasion, are
often more dreaded than serpents or the wild beasts of the forest. They
usually bury themselves under the toe nails, where they lay their eggs.
If not immediately removed they cause painful and often dangerous
sores. It is related of Sir Robert Schomburgk that a negress once
extracted from his feet no fewer than eighty-three jiggers at one
sitting.</p>
<p class="footnote">The <i>coloradito</i>, called by the French
<i>b&ecirc;te-rouge</i>, and in some places known as the red tick, is
almost invisible to the naked eye. It is found everywhere in the
equatorial lowlands, especially during the rainy season. Its bite
causes an intolerable itching, and when one has been exposed to the
combined attacks of many of these microscopic insects, the result is as
painful as the burning produced by the poisoned tunic of Nessus.
Schomburgk, in describing his personal experience, declares that
&ldquo;the bite of this insect drives by day the perspiration of
anguish from every pore, and at night makes one&rsquo;s hammock
resemble the gridiron on which St. Lawrence was roasted.&rdquo; Simson
informs us that the intense irritation produced by the bites of the
b&ecirc;te-rouge at times drove him almost to the verge of madness.
&ldquo;Notwithstanding every effort of self-control,&rdquo; he writes,
&ldquo;to bear the itching sensation, I have many times awoke in the
night to find myself sitting up in the bed, and literally tearing the
skin off my legs, where most of the insects collect, with my
nails.&rdquo; Mosquitoes and the zancudos are bad enough, but, as a
pest, the <i>coloradito</i> is far worse. Truth to tell, our greatest
suffering in the tropics came from the <i>coloradito</i>, but it was in
great measure due to our lack of precaution. Had we exercised more care
we should have avoided many painful hours. The best way to allay the
pain is to rub the part affected with rum or lemon juice.</p>
<p class="footnote">Padre Gumilla assures us that leaving the Gulf of
Paria and entering the Orinoco, or any of the tropical rivers, is
tantamount to engaging in a fierce and continued warfare, day and
night, with countless insects of all kinds. Of certain mosquitoes, he
tells us, their sharp, uninterrupted noise is more to be dreaded than
their piercing proboscis.</p>
<p class="footnote">So trying and difficult did Raleigh consider a
voyage up the Orinoco that he declared it a task &ldquo;fitter for
boies,&rdquo; than for men of mature years, although, when he visited
Guiana, he was nearly three lustra younger than was the author of the
present work when he made the journey herein described.&nbsp;<a class=

statements made by travelers from the time of Gumilla to our own
regarding the insect pests of tropical America, the reader will no
doubt be inclined to agree with Sydney Smith that it is better for one
to become reconciled to the trials of our northern climate than to
expose oneself to the still greater trials in the lands bordering the
equator. In a characteristic article in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> on
Waterton&rsquo;s <i>Wanderings</i>, the genial humorist has the
following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Insects are the curse of tropical climates.
The b&ecirc;te-rouge lays the foundation of a tremendous ulcer. In a
moment you are covered with ticks. Chigoes bury themselves in your
flesh, and hatch a large colony of young chigoes in a few hours. They
will not live together, but every chigoe sets up a separate ulcer, and
has his own private portion of pus. Flies get entry into your mouth,
into your eyes, into your nose; you eat flies, drink flies, and breathe
flies. Lizards, cockroaches, and snakes, get into the bed; ants eat up
the books; scorpions sting you on the foot. Everything bites, stings,
or bruises; every second of your existence you are wounded by some
piece of animal life that nobody has ever seen before, except
Swammerdam and Meriam. An insect with eleven legs is swimming in your
teacup, a nondescript with nine wings is struggling in the small beer,
or a caterpillar with several dozen eyes in his belly is hastening over
your bread and butter! All nature is alive, and seems to be gathering
all her entomological hosts to eat you up, as you are standing, out of
your coat, waistcoat, and breeches. Such are the tropics. All this
reconciles us to our dews, fogs, vapours, and drizzle&mdash;to our
apothecaries rushing about with gargles and tinctures&mdash;to our old,
British, constitutional coughs, sore throats, and swelled

Venezuelans living on the Orinoco, declares that &ldquo;All are

nothing is really serious to them.&rdquo; Certain of his adjectives may

the flora of the forests of Venezuelan Guiana one can truthfully say
what Richard Schomburgk affirms of the flora of British Guiana. In his
<i lang="de">Reisen in British Guiana</i>, Vol. II, p. 216, speaking of
the plants in the country around Roraima, he writes as follows:
&ldquo;Not only the orchids, but the shrubs and low trees were unknown
to me. Every shrub, herb and tree was new to me, if not as to the
family, yet as to the species. I stood on the border of an unknown
plant-zone, full of wondrous forms which lay as if by magic before
me.... Every step revealed something new.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">As an evidence of the variety of plant life in this
part of the world, it suffices to state that Bonpland, the companion of
Humboldt in his memorable journey to South America, discovered no fewer
than six hundred species of new plants on his way to the Cassiquiare,
and that, too, in spite of the fact that his investigations were
necessarily confined entirely to the banks of the river along which he
passed. There are still many large tracts in Venezuela and Colombia
that have never been visited by the botanist.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

a certain cattle farm in the llanos: &ldquo;Its area, would measure at
least eighty square leagues, or about one hundred and fifty thousand
acres of the richest land, but which under the present backward and
revolutionary state of the country is comparatively valueless to the
owner. The number of cattle dispersed throughout the length and breadth
of this wide extent of prairie land was computed to be about a hundred
thousand head, and at one time, ten thousand horses; but what with the
<i>peste</i>, revolutionary exactions, and skin hunters, comparatively
very few of the former and none of the latter have been left.&rdquo;

unstable and turbulent condition from which the country has so long
suffered cannot be attributed to a defective constitution or to
impracticable laws. The constitution of Venezuela is modeled after that
of the United States, and the laws are largely based on the best
legislation of other countries. But this is not sufficient. Of this
unhappy country, and especially of its rulers, one may exclaim in the
words of the great Florentine poet:&mdash;</p>

quell sedition and dissension and break up the factions that had so
long made law and order impossible, rulers were brought in from

<p class="first">&ldquo;Having traveled many days in the manner above
described, we finally reached the mouth of the much desired Meta. Every
one rejoiced, thinking their gravest solicitudes were at an end. And
although no human habitations were visible, nevertheless the land was
of a bright and cheerful aspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in sonorous <i>octava rima</i>, does the illustrious
historiographer of Tunja<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3276src" href=
"#xd21e3276" name="xd21e3276src">2</a> give expression to the joy which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>Alonso de Herrera and his companions experienced
on their arrival at what they fondly hoped was the goal of their long
and daring expedition. It was now more than a year since they had left
the mouth of the Orinoco. Before starting on their adventurous journey,
they had to construct flat-bottomed boats and make other preparations
indispensable for a voyage so replete with danger and of such uncertain
duration.</p>
<p>Herrera was the second of the conquistadores to reach the Meta by
the Orinoco. He was drawn thither by the reports of vast amounts of
gold existing in the province of the Meta. But the reports proved to be
as misleading in his case as they had been in that of so many other
valiant leaders of expeditions in search of another Mexico or Peru. He
had scarcely reached what he was led to believe was the land of gold
and precious stones when, in a fight with Indians, his life was cut
short by a poisoned arrow.</p>
<p>Unlike Herrera, we were glad of our arrival at the Meta, not because
we were in hopes of finding treasure in its neighborhood, but because
we were at last sure that our boat would not be commandeered for
military purposes. True, we had been told at Urbana that there was
nothing to apprehend on this score, but we were not entirely satisfied
with the assurances given. When, however, we had entered the Meta, we
were in Colombian territory and away from Venezuelan telegraphs and
dispatch boats. After this we had no further anxiety, for we had every
reason to believe that we should arrive in due course at our
destination&mdash;Orocu&eacute;.</p>
<p>Although Herrera&rsquo;s voyage to the Meta took place as early as
1535, he was not the first Spaniard to explore this part of South
America. Diego de Ordaz, a captain under <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>Cortes in Mexico, had
preceded him to this region by four years. Instead of continuing his
journey up the Meta, as he had been advised by his Indian guides, who
assured him that toward the west he would find an abundance of gold, he
endeavored to go towards the south on the Orinoco. He found his plans
thwarted by the great rapids he encountered&mdash;probably those of
Atures or Maipures&mdash;and was compelled to return without having
accomplished anything more than making a general reconnoissance of the
country through which he had passed.</p>
<p>I refer especially to the expedition of Diego de Ordaz because it
was the first of those famous expeditions made on the great rivers of
the New World by the conquistadores. He anticipated Orellana&rsquo;s
marvelous voyage down the Amazon by nearly ten years.</p>
<p>I have also another reason&mdash;a personal one&mdash;for alluding
to it. Twenty-five years before my arrival at the juncture of the
Orinoco and the Meta I had made the ascent of Popocatepetl and explored
the same crater from which, more than three and a half centuries
before, Diego de Ordaz, to the great amazement of the Indians, had
taken out sulphur for the manufacture of gunpowder. When scaling this
lofty volcano, I had frequently thought of the courage and endurance of
this dauntless Spaniard in accomplishing a task which was then far more
difficult than it is now. According to Herrera it was then in action,
and the smoke and flames rendered the ascent next to impossible. To the
Indians the crater was the mouth of hell in which tyrants had to be
purified before they could enter the abode of the blest.</p>
<p>But difficult and hazardous as was the ascent of Popocatepetl, the
voyage up the Orinoco was, in the days of Ordaz, far more so. Not so
to-day, when the trip can be made in a steamer with comparative ease
and comfort. But it did seem strange&mdash;passing strange&mdash;that
we two should have visited two such unlikely places and so widely
separated from each other in time and space. It was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>almost like having a rendezvous with an old
friend. I confess that I not only thought of Ordaz, but imagined that I
felt his presence.</p>
<p>The great conquistador should have been permitted not only to wear a
burning volcano on his armorial bearings&mdash;as was allowed him by
Charles V&mdash;but he should also have been granted the privilege of
having depicted on his coat of arms one of the great rapids of the
Orinoco&mdash;La Puerta del Infierno&mdash;for instance, which he had
so successfully passed. His achievements have been eclipsed by many of
his contemporaries, but in enterprise and daring he is second to
none.</p>
<p>As I have said, we were glad&mdash;very glad&mdash;to reach the
Meta, but I personally felt a pang of regret on leaving the Orinoco.
Nothing would have pleased me more than to have continued on the waters
of this great river until we should have reached the wonderful
Cassiquiare, which connects the Orinoco with the great Rio Negro and
with the still greater Amazon. I consoled myself with the thought that
possibly I might be able to make this journey later on, and then
probably extend it through the Madeira, Mamor&eacute;, Pilcomayo and
Parana to Buenos Ayres. This had long been a fond dream of mine. Will
it ever be realized? In the language of one of my Spanish companions,
<i>Dios ver&aacute;</i>&mdash;God will see&mdash;for it is not
impossible.</p>
<p>I say it is not impossible, because a part of the journey&mdash;from
the Orinoco to the Amazon&mdash;has often been made and is still
frequently made every year by traders, missionaries and others. And
contrary to what is often asserted, it is not an undertaking of any
particular difficulty or danger. The same may be said of the journey
from the Amazon to the Parana.</p>
<p>There is reason to believe that the first to make the journey
between the Amazon and the Orinoco, by way of the Cassiquiare, were
L&oacute;pe de Aguirre, the traitor, and his companions, who went from
Peru to the northern coast of Venezuela in 1561. The first white man to
pass <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>from the Orinoco to the Rio Negro by the
Cassiquiare was the missionary, Padre Rom&aacute;n. He made the round
trip from his mission near the mouth of the Meta to the Rio Negro in
about eight months, and at a time when some of his
associates&mdash;Padre Gumilla among the number&mdash;were endeavoring
to prove that there was no connection between the Orinoco and the
Amazon, and that, consequently, a journey from one to the other by boat
was impossible.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3337src" href="#xd21e3337"
name="xd21e3337src">3</a></p>
<p>After Padre Rom&aacute;n&rsquo;s time the journey between the
Amazon, the Orinoco and vice versa was a very ordinary occurrence for
missionaries and traders. It was made in 1756 by the Spanish commission
sent to settle the boundary line between Brazil and Venezuela, by
Humboldt and Bonpland, Michelena y Rojas and numerous other explorers
who have left us accounts of their travels.</p>
<p>Since the missions have been suppressed the Indian population
between Urbana and San Fernando de Atabapo has greatly diminished and,
as a result, the traveler at times finds great difficulty in securing
boats and rowers. In Humboldt&rsquo;s time the trip was comparatively
easy. There were flourishing missions along the entire course of his
travels&mdash;through New Andalusia and Barcelona, through the llanos
of Venezuela, along the Orinoco from Angostura to Urbana and from
Urbana to the Brazilian frontier on the Rio Negro.</p>
<p>Now all this is changed. If he could return to the scene of his
famous explorations he would not be able to locate even the site of
many of the missions where he was so kindly entertained and of whose
hospitality he writes in terms of such unstinted praise. From Ciudad
Bolivar to San Carlos on the Rio Negro&mdash;a distance of nearly a
thousand miles&mdash;he would not find more than one or two at most.
Even San Fernando de Atabapo, that in Humboldt&rsquo;s time was the
capital of a province and an important missionary centre, is to-day
without a pastor. A priest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>from Ciudad Bolivar goes to this
distant place&mdash;more than seven hundred miles away&mdash;once a
year to look after the spiritual welfare of the few inhabitants that
still remain there. The other missions, of which the illustrious savant
gives us such interesting accounts, have long since disappeared, and
the places they occupied are now covered with a dark, impenetrable
forest growth. Most of these were suppressed at the time of the War of
Independence, or died out during the countless revolutions that have
since desolated the country.</p>
<p>In the kindly and hospitable <i>padres</i> in charge of these
missions, Humboldt always found counselors and friends, and in some of
his longest and most difficult journeys they also proved to be his best
and most intelligent guides. It was through them, too, that he was able
always to obtain food, boats and boatmen&mdash;three essentials that
the traveler of to-day often finds it extremely difficult to
procure.</p>
<p>Shortly before entering the Meta we passed through the Raudal de
Cariben, a swift and foaming cataract, which rushes between immense
masses of black granite that stand like sentinels on both sides of the
river to warn the navigator against the perils of further advance.</p>
<p>The forms of the rocks are bizarre in the extreme. Some of them are
columnar in structure and resemble the sombre pillars of a Hindoo
temple. Others are more fantastic in shape and would easily pass for a
Sardinian noraghe in ruins. From one point of view the rocks present
the appearance of a dismantled fortress with its bastions, parapets and
embrasures; its glacis, scarps and counter-scarps.</p>
<p>But the most singular spectacle of all is a formation on the right
bank of the river that seemed, for all the world, to be a petrified
battleship&mdash;just such a man of war as might have been fashioned by
the hammer of Thor and used by a race of Titans. The celebrated Garden
of the Gods in Colorado does not exhibit more grotesque or diversified
rock formations than does the Raudal of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>Cariben and it is
entirely devoid of that wonderful setting given the Orinoco by the
luxuriant tropical forest and a cataract that resembles in many
respects the rapids above the Falls of Niagara.</p>
<p>One is not surprised to learn that the Indians have woven many
legends about this cataract, which is almost as picturesque as are
those of Atures and Maipures further up the river. And still less is
one surprised to read of the accounts given by the early missionaries
of the difficulties and perils attending the passage of these rapids.
For small craft, especially canoes, it is necessary to keep them near
the shore and punt them, or pull them along by ropes. With our
stern-wheeler we never felt that there was any danger, but our progress
was exceedingly slow. At times we were actually at a stand still and
once or twice it looked as if we were going to be carried down stream,
so great was the force of the current. But finally, after a long and
determined struggle, we passed the cataract in safety. To be frank, we
all experienced a feeling of relief when we saw that all the reefs and
<i>remolinos</i>&mdash;whirlpools&mdash;were behind us, and that we
were again once more in placid and safe water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i lang="es">Este raudal es muy maluco</i>,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3375src" href="#xd21e3375" name=
"xd21e3375src">4</a>&mdash;this cataract is very bad&mdash;said our
pilot to us after the strain was over. &ldquo;It is much more difficult
to steer a boat through it than through <i>La Puerto del Infierno</i>,
near Ciudad Bolivar.&rdquo; Fortunately for all concerned, he knew his
business well and was as conscientious as he was skillful. He had been
navigating the Orinoco and the Meta for nearly twenty years and was
thoroughly familiar with every feature and peculiarity of both of them.
He had never had an accident and was justly proud of his record. He had
the eye of a hawk and could judge of the relative depths of the water
by differences of color that were quite imperceptible to the ordinary
observer. Only once, during our entire journey, did we graze a sandbar,
and that was only for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>a moment. But it was quite
sufficient to make a young Ethiopian among our crew think that his last
day had arrived, and that we were surely going to the bottom. Greatly
frightened, he turned to us and remarked, &ldquo;It am very unwholesome
to travel in dis ribber. Dat am certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at the mouth of the Meta, according to certain alarmists whom
we had met in Ciudad Bolivar, that we should be exposed to grave danger
from savages. A band of murderous Guahibos, led by a certain
sambo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3390src" href="#xd21e3390" name=
"xd21e3390src">5</a>&mdash;a refugee from the llanos of
Venezuela&mdash;had for some time, we were assured, been stationed at
this point, where they attacked every vessel that passed by, and where
they had already robbed and killed a large number of people who had
ventured too near the outlaw&rsquo;s lair. The first intimation of
their presence, we were told, would be a shower of poisoned arrows from
the dense underbrush where the enemy would be concealed. But this
report, like so many others regarding the dangers of our journey,
proved to be unfounded. There was not a Guahibo, much less a sambo
leader to be seen anywhere. Everything was as quiet as on the
proverbial Potomac.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Meta, Padre Gilli says: &ldquo;Its width is greater
than that of a dozen Tibers, and in the summer season, when the wind is
high, the waves become very large.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3398src" href="#xd21e3398" name="xd21e3398src">6</a> Far from
being an exaggeration, as might appear to the reader, this statement is
rather an underestimate of the reality, at least as regards its
breadth. In places it is fully two miles wide&mdash;almost as broad as
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>Orinoco near the delta. And this is not because
of the shallowness of the river. According to Humboldt, its mean depth
near its mouth is thirty-six feet, and it sometimes attains to more
than twice this depth.</p>
<p>One of the chief affluents of the Meta from the north is the river
Casanare. We were much interested in this on account of its historical
associations. It was down this river that Don Antonio Berrio, the
son-in-law of the famous adelantado, Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, came
on his celebrated expedition from Bogot&aacute; to Trinidad. He was the
first white man to undertake this long journey, and, considering the
difficulties of travel at that time, through an unknown land, and often
through the territory of hostile savages, his finally attaining his
destination was, indeed, a wonderful achievement, comparable, in some
respects, with that of Orellana down the Amazon a few decades
before.</p>
<p>For a long time the Casanare river was the favorite route of the
missionaries who went from Bogot&aacute; to evangelize the various
tribes who dwelt in the valley of the Meta and in the valleys of many
of its chief tributaries. Indeed, for a long time some of the most
flourishing missions in New Granada were in the country through which
we are now passing. But after the religious orders in charge of the
missions were withdrawn or suppressed, the Indians returned to their
native wilds, and gradually reverted to their original savage
condition.</p>
<p>Much as we tried, we could not discover even a vestige of any of the
former missions on the Meta. And not only have the former villages and
towns disappeared, but even the Indian tribes who, at one time, were so
numerous on both sides of the river, seem to have vanished also. We
sailed an entire week on the Meta without seeing or hearing a single
human being. In some cases the Indians have, for greater security,
retired into the depths of the forest. In others, war and disease have
done their work and whole tribes, as in other parts of South America,
have been exterminated. The names of the mission villages and towns
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>along the Meta still figure on the maps, but the
traveler is unable to find the slightest trace of even the sites on
which they were located.</p>
<p>About the least favorable place in the world for cultivating
literature would, one would think, be in a rude hut in an Indian
village on the Meta. And yet, strange as it may seem, one of the most
interesting and valuable works that have ever been written on the
missions of South America, on the manners, customs, and languages of
the various Indian tribes of the plains and forests of Colombia, was
produced on the banks of the Meta.</p>
<p>Its author was the zealous and scholarly Padre Juan Rivero, who
spent sixteen years as a missionary in this part of the New World. He
wrote many works on doctrinal subjects in their own language for the
benefit of the Indians. Besides this he gave to the world what are
probably the most useful grammars in existence of several of the more
important languages and dialects spoken by the various tribes among
whom he labored with such marked success.</p>
<p>The work, however, to which I specially refer, is his <i lang=
"es">Historia de las Misiones de los Llanos de Casanare y los Rios
Orinoco y Meta</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3420src" href=
"#xd21e3420" name="xd21e3420src">7</a> It has been the basis of many
other works on the same subject&mdash;Gumilla&rsquo;s <i lang="es">El
Orinoco Ilustrado</i> <span class="corr" id="xd21e3428" title=
"Source: &mdash;"></span>for example&mdash;but, notwithstanding the
numerous books that have been written since then on the Indians of the
Orinoco and its tributaries, Rivero&rsquo;s is still <i>facile
princeps</i>, and must always be consulted by one who desires accurate
knowledge regarding the condition, character, rivalries and wars of the
divers savage tribes to whom he preached the gospel of peace and
brotherly love. Besides this, he gives us exact information concerning
the geography of the country through which he passed and affords us
entertaining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>accounts of its fauna and flora. He supplies us,
too, with rare and curious data of great scientific value to the
historian and ethnologist, and gives us the benefit of his unique
experience as to the best means of civilizing and Christianizing the
savage hordes that in his day&mdash;1720 to 1736&mdash;wandered over
the plains and through the woodlands of northern South America.</p>
<p>It was indeed in consequence of the recognized importance of his
work, as a contribution to the solution of certain social and
economical difficulties, that confronted the Colombian government some
decades ago, that it was finally published in 1883, after lying in the
dust in manuscript for nearly a hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>For several years some of the Indians of eastern Colombia had given
great trouble to the whites in the more distant settlements. Robberies
and massacres and atrocities were becoming daily more frequent and the
numerous savage hordes threatened to extend their incursions toward the
villages and towns of the interior. The inhabitants were in
consternation and called upon the government to devise immediate means
for their safety and protection. The authorities were willing to do
anything in their power but did not know what steps to take. They had
to deal with a foe about whose character, numbers and home they were
almost entirely ignorant.</p>
<p>It was then that someone, by a happy inspiration, suggested calling
in as adviser one who knew more about the Indians than any of the
officials of the government, one who had long lived among them and had
won their confidence and affection, one, consequently, who would be
better able to counsel in the emergency that confronted the government
than any one else that could be named.</p>
<p>The adviser and expert was one who had been dead nearly a century
and a half&mdash;the sainted missionary Padre Juan Rivero. He could not
testify orally, but his great manuscript work on the Indians was in the
archives of Bogot&aacute;, and it was decided to print it at once, and
in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>wise give the public the benefit of the great
missionary&rsquo;s advice and utilize his knowledge of a wild and
untractable race that had already become a serious menace to the peace
and prosperity of the country.</p>
<p>When published, the book was found to be so modern in many of the
views expressed, so well adapted to supply information then sorely
needed, that it appeared to be written expressly to meet recent
difficulties and throw light on questions that modern legislators and
political economists had been discussing, but without sufficient
knowledge or the necessary data. Both the data and the knowledge were
furnished by Padre Rivero of happy memory.</p>
<p>In the preface to his work the author tells us of the difficulties
under which he labored in its production. &ldquo;The banks of the
Meta,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;have been the workshop in which this
work has been forged. Here the inconvenience of the house in which I
live, the concourse of Indians with their importunate demands, the
visits of the heathen Chiricoas, who are the most noisy chatterers
conceivable, and various other disturbances, which would require time
to recount, have been the retirement which I have enjoyed, and the
quiet which has been allowed me for such an
undertaking.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3451src" href=
"#xd21e3451" name="xd21e3451src">8</a></p>
<p>Speaking of the Indians who inhabited the llanos and the banks of
such rivers as the Casanare and the Meta, he declares they were as
numerous as the sands of the seashore and the stars of heaven. During
more than three <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>weeks spent in the valley of the Meta, we
saw but one small encampment of wild Indians&mdash;<i lang="es">Indios
bravos</i>&mdash;about midway between Cariben and Orocu&eacute;. They
greeted us in a friendly manner and seemed to be a very harmless
people. They were Guahibos, those merciless savages who, we were
assured, would be lying in ambush awaiting our arrival, prepared to
assail us with a shower of poisoned arrows, preparatory to serving us
up at one of their cannibalistic feasts.</p>
<p>As to the monkeys, skipping from tree to tree along the Meta, and
exciting the admiration of the traveler by their antics and grimaces,
he avers that their number is an embarrassment to the arrows directed
against them. Yet, although we were daily on the lookout for these
interesting animals, as well as for others popularly supposed to exist
in countless numbers along the rivers and in the forests of Venezuela
and Colombia, we never got a glimpse of even a single specimen of any
of the quadrumanous tribes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3475src" href=
"#xd21e3475" name="xd21e3475src">9</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>Padre Rivero was probably the first to give an account of that
curious custom&mdash;the <i>Couvade</i>&mdash;which prevailed among the
Indian tribes with whom he was acquainted. As is known, this
extraordinary custom has, at one time or another, obtained in all
quarters of the globe&mdash;in Asia, Africa, in Europe as well as in
North and South America. Marco Polo found evidence of it during his
travels in the Orient. It is, however, in South America that it is most
prevalent and where the prescriptions connected with it are most
scrupulously observed. And it was the early missionaries who have
furnished us with the most interesting data regarding this widespread
custom, and which, according to recent travelers, is still as prevalent
in certain parts of South America as it was generations ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a ridiculous thing,&rdquo; says Rivero, &ldquo;of which
I am about to speak, but it is nevertheless a reality. It is this. When
a woman gives birth to a child, it is the husband that is to receive
the care and attention given on such occasions and not the miserable
woman. Scarcely is the child born, when the husband, with the behavior
of one who has escaped from a grave mischance, goes to bed complaining
as if he were ill. The wife then bestows on him the most tender care,
as if on this the welfare of the home depended. As a reason for these
superstitious practices and ridiculous ceremonies, they assert that, if
during this time they should go walking, they would trample on the head
of the infant; if they should chop wood, they would cleave the
child&rsquo;s head; if they should shoot birds in the mountain, they
would infallibly shoot the newly born. And so is it with other foolish
things of a similar character which they firmly
believe.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3499src" href="#xd21e3499"
name="xd21e3499src">10</a></p>
<p>The time during which the father must keep to his bed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>or
hammock, varies from a few days to several weeks. In some tribes it is
longer than in others. During this season and even for months
afterwards some articles of food are quite tabooed. He must then
abstain from certain kinds of birds or fish, &ldquo;firmly believing
that this would injure the child&rsquo;s stomach, and that it would
participate in the natural faults of the animals on which the father
had fed. If, for example, the father ate turtle, the child would be
deaf and have no brains, like this animal; if he ate manatee, the child
would have little round eyes like this creature.&rdquo; Again, if he
eats the flesh of a waterhaas&mdash;Capybara&mdash;a large rodent with
very protruding teeth&mdash;the teeth of the child will grow like those
of this animal; or if he eats the flesh of the spotted labba, the
child&rsquo;s skin will become spotted. Among some tribes the father is
forbidden to bathe, to smoke, or to use snuff, or even to scratch
himself with his finger nails. In their place he must employ &ldquo;for
this purpose a splinter, specially provided, from the mid-rib of a
cokerite palm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobrizhoffer, a noted missionary in Paraguay, in his very
interesting <i>History of the Abipones</i>, is even more explicit about
this superstitious practice. &ldquo;No sooner,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;do you hear that the wife has borne a child, than you will see
the Abipone husband lying in bed, huddled up with mats and skins, lest
some rude breath of air should touch him, fasting, kept in private, and
for a number of days abstaining religiously from certain viands. You
would swear it was he who had had the child.... They are fully
persuaded that the sobriety and quiet of the father is effectual for
the well-being of the new-born offspring and even necessary.... And
they believe, too, that the father&rsquo;s carelessness influences the
new-born offspring, from a natural bond and sympathy between both.
Hence if the child comes to a premature end, its death is attributed by
the women to the father&rsquo;s intemperance, this or that cause being
assigned. Among these would be that he did not abstain from meat, that
he had loaded his stomach with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>waterhog, that he had swum
across the river when the air was chilly, that he had neglected to
shave off his long eye-brows, that he had devoured underground honey,
stamping on the bees with his feet, that he had ridden till he was
tired and sweated. With ravings like this the crowd of women accuse the
father with impunity of causing the child&rsquo;s death and are
accustomed to pour curses on the unoffending husband.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3513src" href="#xd21e3513" name=
"xd21e3513src">11</a></p>
<p>The whole subject of the couvade opens up many interesting questions
for the ethnologist, and its careful study may be productive of much
valuable information regarding the early races of mankind. For the
student of linguistics and folklore, there is still among the little
known tribes of Eastern Colombia a broad and rich field for research
concerning the languages, customs and traditions of these people, and
the works of the early missionaries are replete with the most precious
data respecting them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3557src" href=
"#xd21e3557" name="xd21e3557src">12</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>As we quietly sailed up the broad forest-clad Meta, we could not
help harking back to the distant past, when, ever and anon, along its
banks were to be seen the smiling homes and villages of happy Indians
under the watchful eye and protecting arm of their &ldquo;father
priest,&rdquo; and comparing it with the present desolate and deserted
land that for days at a time does not exhibit the slightest trace of a
human habitation.</p>
<p>Then, in the beautiful language of Colombia&rsquo;s great lyric
poet, D. Jos&eacute; Joaquin Ort&iacute;z, &ldquo;One clime and one
region was not sufficient for the ardor that inflamed the breasts of
the holy disciples of Christ. They will go to enkindle the pure flame
of love in the breast of the savage, at the same time teaching him the
arts of peace in the immense solitudes which are fertilized by the
Arauca, and the Meta and the Casanare and the torrential Upia. They
will scale the ever-precipitous throne of the deafening storm, and will
finally hear the canticle sounding in praise of the redeeming cross, in
as many tongues and by as many tribes as people my native land from the
West to the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, too, was to be seen one of those charming gatherings so
beautifully pictured by our own Longfellow in &ldquo;The Children of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thus all the children of
the Mission hasten, at the sound of the bell, to gather about the
cross, which is raised on high, and to approach near the venerable man
who with his silver locks towers above so many infantile heads. Oh,
neither Plato nor Socrates, famous in the annals of knowledge, after
long years of continuous vigils, ever knew what these poor, ingenuous
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>children learnt from the tremulous lips of the
old man at the foot of a tree-trunk in the forest.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3577src" href="#xd21e3577" name=
"xd21e3577src">13</a></p>
<p>Much, however, as we were disposed to linger on the glories of the
past, and to regret the absence of what, in days gone by, possessed
such an intense human interest, we were not insensible to the marvelous
natural beauties of river and forest that defiled before our admiring
gaze from morning until night.</p>
<p>At one time it is a colossal <i>Bombax ceiba</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3620src" href="#xd21e3620" name="xd21e3620src">14</a> that
claims our attention. This tree is remarkable alike for the height it
often attains and for the wonderful expanse of its branches. To support
such a giant of the forest, Nature has made a special provision. It is
supplied by large buttresses, from six to twelve inches thick and from
ten to twenty feet above the ground, which project like rays from all
sides of its lofty trunk. Were it not for these peculiar stays the tree
would be uprooted by the first violent wind to which it might be
exposed.</p>
<p>At another time it is a huge fig tree that we admire, or a tall and
graceful <i>Candelero</i>, so named from its resemblance to an ornate
candlestick. In both cases we observe <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>the same peculiar,
buttressed roots that are so characteristic of the ceiba and some other
giants of the forest.</p>
<p>But more wonderful far than the ceiba is a tree called by the
natives by the expressive name of <i>Matapalo</i>&mdash;Tree-Killer. It
is a species of fig tree, known to naturalists as the <i>Ficus
dendroica</i>. It is at first but a feeble, climbing shrub, sometimes
resembling a vine, but it soon spreads itself over the tree on which it
has fastened itself and eventually encloses it in a tubular mass. It is
a veritable boa constrictor of the vegetable world, for it sooner or
later crushes the life out of its victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the incarcerated trunk has been stifled and destroyed,
the grotesque form of the parasite, tubular, corkscrew-like, or
otherwise fantastically contorted, and frequently admitting the light
through interstices like loopholes in a <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e3640" title="Source: turrent">turret</span>, continues to
maintain an independent existence among the straight-stemmed trees of
the forest&mdash;the image of an eccentric genius in the midst of a
group of sedate citizens.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3643src"
href="#xd21e3643" name="xd21e3643src">15</a></p>
<p>Another remarkable tree seen in the tropics is the cow tree, the
<i lang="es">palo de vaca</i>, or <i lang="es">arbol de
leche</i>&mdash;the milk tree of the natives. Its sap resembles milk in
taste and appearance, and is extensively used as an aliment, especially
by the negroes and mestizos. In referring to this strange specimen of
plant life, Humboldt remarks: &ldquo;Amidst the great number of curious
phenomena which I have observed in the course of my travels, I confess
there are few that have made so powerful an impression on me as the
aspect of the cow tree.... It is not here the solemn shades of forests,
the majestic course of rivers, the mountain wrapped in eternal snow,
that excite our emotion. A few drops of vegetable juice recall to our
minds all the powerfulness and the fecundity of nature. On the barren
flank of a rock grows a tree with coriaceous and dry leaves. Its large
woody roots can scarcely penetrate into the stone. For several months
of the year not a single shower moistens <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>its foliage. Its
branches appear dead and dried; but when the trunk is pierced there
flows from it a sweet and nourishing milk. It is at the rising of the
sun that this vegetable fountain is most abundant. The negroes and
natives are then seen hastening from all quarters, furnished with large
bowls to receive the milk, which grows yellow and thickens at the
surface. Some empty the bowls under the tree itself, others carry the
juice home to their children.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3662src" href="#xd21e3662" name="xd21e3662src">16</a></p>
<p>After leaving the Orinoco we made no attempt to travel at night. The
ever-changing bed of the river, the sand banks, the large trunks of
trees that were hurried along by the current, eddies and rapids and
rocks and islands unnumerable, made sailing at night quite impossible.
For this reason, at nightfall we sometimes moored at the river&rsquo;s
bank, attaching our boat by a rope to the nearest tree, but, more
frequently, in order to escape mosquitoes and other insects, we dropped
anchor in mid-river.</p>
<p>The night was always tranquil, and we were never disturbed by any of
those noises&mdash;the howling of monkeys and the cries of
jaguars&mdash;which, in tropical forests, are usually supposed to be so
pronounced a feature. Nor were we ever troubled by mosquitoes during
our entire trip of two weeks from Ciudad Bolivar. And never did we deem
it necessary to take the precaution of putting up our
<i>mosquiteros</i>&mdash;mosquito nets&mdash;to protect ourselves from
the <i>plaga</i>&mdash;plague&mdash;which we had been assured would be
a nightly visitant during our entire journey.</p>
<p>We had been told, too, that the intense heat of the atmosphere would
be another cause of continual suffering<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>&mdash;day and night.
But we did not find it so. At no time did the thermometer rise higher
than 86&deg; F., and it frequently sank as low as 66&deg; F., when we
were glad to put on wraps of some kind. We observed that a variation of
a few degrees was more appreciable than the same variation in our
northern latitudes. A drop of two or three degrees below 70&deg; F.
produced a greater sensation of cold than a fall to 50&deg; would
produce in New York.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, one need not remain long in the tropics before
he becomes affected by very slight changes of temperature. And another
fact is soon impressed on the observer, which is that the heat in the
tropics is not so much greater than that in more northern latitudes, as
measured by the thermometer. It is the almost uniform temperature, day
and night, the whole year through, that eventually becomes so
depressing and so difficult to endure.</p>
<p>At no time, either on the Orinoco or the Meta, did we ever see the
thermometer rise within fifteen degrees of the intense heat one
frequently experiences during the summer in New York and Washington.
The nights, although usually warm, were never unpleasant. A sheet was
generally sufficient covering, but we sometimes found it necessary to
use a blanket. Only once were we annoyed&mdash;and that for but a short
time&mdash;by insects, and that was because we moored near the bank
under large, overhanging trees, which seemed to be alive with certain
bugs of a very noxious odor.</p>
<p>Once or twice during each day it was necessary to stop to take on
wood, which was usually ready and piled up on the bank. Sometimes,
however, the owner would demand more than the captain was willing to
give, and that meant that the crew was then obliged to go into the
forest and cut fuel sufficient to take us to the next wood-pile further
up the river. Fortunately, we were not often obliged to cut the wood
ourselves. Each time we did so meant an extra delay of three or four
hours.</p>
<p>Besides stopping for wood, it was at times necessary to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>call
for provisions, fruits, chickens, eggs, and a certain <i lang=
"es">queso &aacute; mano</i>&mdash;hand-made cheese&mdash;of which the
Llaneros are very fond and which we found very palatable.</p>
<p>On one occasion our supply of beef became exhausted, and it was
necessary to stop&mdash;about noon&mdash;at a <i>hato</i> along the
river to get a heifer for our next meal. Unfortunately, the owner of
the ranch was not at home. He was out among his herds several miles
distant. Our steward, nothing disconcerted, started in search of him,
but before he had found the proprietor of the herd, and had gotten the
desired <i>novilla</i>&mdash;heifer&mdash;on board, it was dark. There
was then nothing to do but tie our boat up near the house in which we
had spent most of the afternoon, and wait until the following morning
before continuing our journey.</p>
<p>At first, it would appear that such delays would prove very
annoying, but this was very far from being the case. On the contrary,
it was most interesting, as it gave us an opportunity of getting
acquainted with the people, and of familiarizing ourselves with their
mode of life and occupations, and enjoying many interesting
conversations with them about matters in which they were most
concerned. We always found them very hospitable and very entertaining.
They always gave us a cordial welcome to their humble home, and rarely
allowed us to depart without giving us something from their simple
store. Sometimes it was a brace of chickens, at other times a basket of
fruit, a calabash of eggs, or generous piece of <i lang="es">queso
&aacute; mano</i>&mdash;which was made by the mistress of the house
herself.</p>
<p>Here we were among people who lived the simple life, and appeared
all the happier for it. We saw no evidences of suffering anywhere. The
only thing that seemed to concern them was the instability of the
government. True, Colombia had been in the enjoyment of peace for
several years past, but every now and then some gossip-monger would
circulate reports about another uprising in some part of the country,
and about the imminent danger to which the men were exposed of being
drafted into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161"
name="pb161">161</a>]</span>army, and of being torn away from their
families, to whom they are devotedly attached.</p>

Fuel.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Occasionally, while the crew was cutting wood, we were able to make
a collection of orchids, of which there are along the Meta many
wonderfully beautiful species. At one time our deck was a veritable
bower of all kinds of orchids of the most brilliant colors and of the
strangest imaginable forms. Some of them possessed a most delicate
fragrance, while others emitted a delightful perfume that spread over
the greater part of our deck.</p>
<p>Linn&aelig;us knew only about a dozen exotic orchids, and expressed
it as his opinion that when the world was fully explored by botanists,
it might probably yield a hundred species all told. How surprised he
would be if he could now return to the world and find that the species
of this curious plant are actually counted by thousands! To English
horticulturists alone some thousands of species are known. Even some of
the many genera of this extensive order contain hundreds of species. Of
odontoglossums there are more than a hundred species catalogued. Of
oncidiums more than two hundred and fifty species have been described.
Of dendrobiums between three and four hundred species are known, while
the genus <i>Habenaria</i> counts more than four hundred species. Then
there are the countless hybrids&mdash;and their number is rapidly
increasing&mdash;that, during the last few years, have been produced in
the conservatories of Europe and America.</p>
<p>Orchids are found in all parts of the world; in the marshes and
groves of the lowlands and in the lofty plateaus of mountain ranges.
But it is in the warm and humid regions of the equator that they occur
in the greatest variety and profusion. Twenty years ago the number of
species known in Venezuela alone exceeded six hundred. In Colombia the
number is probably greater. It is here, too, that some of the choicest
specimens have their habitat. From this country tens of thousands of
plants are shipped annually to the florists of Europe and the United
States. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>As an illustration of the extent of this
industry it suffices to state that a single firm has under cultivation
no fewer than one hundred thousand Odontoglossums, for of this species
alone hundreds of thousands of plants are marketed annually. Other
species are scarcely less popular. To supply the ever-increasing demand
for them, there is now a small army of men continually engaged in the
tropical forests in the work of collecting and preparing them for
shipment. We met several of them in both Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>In the forests along the Meta we could within a small area easily
have collected more orchids than were known to Linn&aelig;us. They were
everywhere&mdash;in the forks of trees, on their branches, on decaying
trunks, on the lianas stretching from one tree to another, and, forming
with the flowering epiphytes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3739src" href=
"#xd21e3739" name="xd21e3739src">17</a> with which they were laden, the
most beautiful tapestry, beside which the most exquisite Gobelin
masterpiece would pale into insignificance. In other places they grew
on bare, precipitous rocks, where they were quite inaccessible, on
prickly cactus plants, near beautiful cascades, or clumps of
arborescent ferns. We found them flourishing near the ocean shore and
near the limits of perpetual snow on the crests of the Cordilleras.</p>
<p>Everywhere they were attractive and worthy of study&mdash;some on
account of their bizarre forms, mimicking insects and butterflies,
others on account of their delicate fragrance, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>and
others still on account of their gorgeous colors, which fairly rival
those of the rainbow.</p>
<p>The odors of orchids are almost as diverse as their colors and
forms. While most of them have an agreeable scent, there are some that
have an unbearably fetid odor. Some emit a faint and delicate perfume;
others possess a fragrance which, although delicious, is almost
overpowering. In some the fragrance is perceptible only in the morning,
in others solely in the evening. Some have a scent like that of
violets, others like that of musk or noyeau, and others again like that
of angelica or cinnamon. More wonderful still, &ldquo;some
species,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;give out different scents at
different times, such as <i>Dendrobium nobile</i>, which smells like
grass in the evening, like honey at noon, and has in the morning a
faint odor of primroses.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3763src"
href="#xd21e3763" name="xd21e3763src">18</a></p>
<p>It was a fortnight, almost to the hour, since we had left Ciudad
Bolivar, when, one bright day, as the sun was approaching the zenith,
our captain, pointing to a tongue of land in the river ahead of us,
said, in a cheerful tone of voice, &ldquo;<i lang="es">A la
vuelt&aacute; esta Orocu&eacute;</i>.&rdquo; Orocu&eacute; is beyond
that point.</p>
<p>And so it was. In a few minutes more we had the town in full view.
We had finished another stage of our journey and that, too, without an
untoward incident of any kind whatsoever. The entire voyage had been
made with comfort and pleasure, and we actually regretted to leave the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>boat on which we had spent so many delightful
and happy hours. It was indeed an experience of a lifetime, one of
enchanting panoramas, such as can be witnessed only along the great
water courses of the equator. The flora, the fauna, the people, the
lands, so rich in romance and so celebrated for the achievements of the
conquistadores&mdash;those of the cross as well as those of the
world&mdash;all fascinated us and enchained our interest during every
moment of our wakeful hours. Yes, it was a memorable,
never-to-be-forgotten experience, one of those experiences that
necessarily exalt the lover of Nature and bring him near to
Nature&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>All the inhabitants in Orocu&eacute;&mdash;men, women and
children&mdash;were gathered on the bank to witness the arrival of our
little steamer. So rarely does anything larger than a small sailboat
come here that the arrival of a steamboat is regarded as an event of
paramount interest and importance. Most grateful to us, for it was so
unexpected, was the welcome accorded us by a number of the leading
citizens of the town. They had been advised by telegraph of our coming,
and had prepared most comfortable quarters for our reception and
entertainment. Escorting us to our temporary home&mdash;which was not
only well furnished but a model of neatness&mdash;we were told, with
true Castilian politeness, accompanied by an air of simplicity and
sincerity that made us feel at home from the first moment,
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Aqu&iacute; est&aacute;n Uds. en su casa. Estamos
todos &aacute; sus &oacute;rdenes.</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e3789"
title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> &ldquo;Here you are in your own
home and we are all at your disposition.&rdquo; The keys of the house
were then handed us, and with them we were accorded the freedom and
hospitality of generous, never-to-be forgotten Orocu&eacute;.

Castellanos was for a while a soldier and afterwards an ecclesiastic,
enjoying a benefice in the town of Tunja, New Granada. Like Pope, he
had an extraordinary faculty for versification, and, like him,
&ldquo;He spoke in numbers for the numbers came.&rdquo; This does not,
however, detract from his authority as a historian. Having taken an
active part in many of the campaigns, which he describes, and, knowing
intimately many of the earlier conquerors of that vast territory now
known as the Republic of Colombia, few writers were better qualified
than he to record the events so graphically depicted in his
<i>Elegias</i>, or to portray the characters of those conquistadores
who figure so prominently among his <i lang="es">Varones Ilustres de
Indias</i>. The first part of his work was published in 1589. The
second and third parts were published in 1850 by Rivadeneyra in the

How like the labors and cares of the bishops of the early Church were
those of the missionaries among the children of the forest! Both were
continually called upon to act as <i>causarum
examinatores</i>&mdash;arbitrators&mdash;and to settle difficulties
that were ever arising among the flocks entrusted to their care. St.
Augustine, the great bishop of Hippo, refers frequently to &ldquo;the
burdensome character of this kind of work, and the distraction from

reader is familiar with the story that has long been in circulation
regarding monkey bridges, and, in his youth, was, no doubt, entertained
by pictures of such imaginary bridges. It is quite safe to say that no
one ever saw such bridges in any part of South America or elsewhere.
And yet the tale regarding their existence has had currency since the
time of Acosta, who visited the New World in 1570. &ldquo;Going from
Nombre de Dios to Panam&aacute;,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I did see in
Capira one of these monkies leape from one tree to an other, which was
on the other side of a river, making me much to wonder. They leape
where they list, winding their tailes about a braunch to shake it; and
when they will leape further than they can at once, they use a pretty
devise, tying themselves by the tailes one of another, and by this
means make as it were a chaine of many; then doe they launch themselves
foorth, and the first holpen by the force of the rest takes holde where
hee list, and so hangs to a bough and helps all the rest, till they be
gotten up.&rdquo; <i lang="es">Historia Natural y Moral de las
Indias</i>, Bk. IV, Chap. 39, Grimston&rsquo;s Translation, London,
1604.</p>
<p class="footnote">The fable about the monkey bridge belongs to the
same class as those that obtain in certain parts of South America
regarding the &ldquo;great devil,&rdquo; or &ldquo;man of the
woods,&rdquo; a near relative of Waterton&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Nondescript.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">Kingsley, in the following passage from <i>Westward
Ho!</i>, referring to some of the things seen and heard by Amyas Leigh
and his companions during their voyage up the Meta, paints a picture
that is doubtless before the mind&rsquo;s eye of most people when they
think of the forest-fringed banks of this river, but which is about as
far from the reality as could well be imagined. &ldquo;The long
processions of monkeys,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;who kept pace with
them along the tree tops and proclaimed their wonder in every
imaginable whistle, and grunt and howl, had ceased to move their
laughter, as much as the roar of the jaguar and the rustle of the boa
had ceased to move their fear.&rdquo; Chap. XXIII.&nbsp;<a class=

Vienna, 1784. &ldquo;Attention has recently been called to a group of
peasant superstitions that have made their appearance in Germany, which
are closely analogous in principle to the couvade, though relating not
to the actual parents of the child but to the god-parents. It is
believed that the habits and proceedings of the god-father and
god-mother affect the child&rsquo;s life and character. Particularly,
the god-father at the christening must not think of disease or madness
lest this come upon the child; he must not look round on the way to the
church lest the child should grow up an idle stare-about; nor must he
carry a knife about him for fear of making the child a suicide; the
god-mother must put on a clean shift to go to the baptism or the baby
will grow up untidy,&rdquo; etc., etc. See E. B. Tylor&rsquo;s

the peculiarities of some savages is the decided objection they
manifest to having their photographs or portraits taken. They imagine
that they lose somewhat of their own life by having their likeness
transferred to paper or other material. And the more perfect their
likeness the greater, they fancy, is the loss which they personally
sustain. Having had some experience with the Indians of North America
regarding this matter, I was not surprised to find that there are in
South America certain Indians who entertain similar notions regarding
the danger of having their pictures taken. Some, to avoid having their
photographs taken, will at once avert their faces; others will run away
to escape the impending danger. Cf. <i>On the Origin of Civilization

Venezuela and Colombia the word <i>parasita</i>&mdash;parasite&mdash;is
usually employed to designate all orchids, no matter what may be the
species or genus. This is a mistake. Orchids are not parasites which,
like the dodder or mistletoe, obtain their nourishment from the plant
or tree on which they grow. They are epiphytes, that get their
nourishment from the surrounding atmosphere, and use the branches and
trunks of trees merely as supports or resting-places. The Old World
genus <i>A&euml;rides</i> is especially remarkable in this respect. One
of the species, <i>A&euml;rides odoratum</i>, &ldquo;has this wonderful
property, that, when brought from the woods, where it grows, into a
house, and suspended in the air, it will grow, flourish and flower for
many years without any nourishment, either from the earth or from
water.&rdquo; For this reason the orchid is appropriately called

<p>In these words of the Bolivian poet, D. Manuel Jos&eacute;
Cort&eacute;s, might aptly be described the extensive forests and
plains of which Orocu&eacute; is the centre. Everywhere is that same
exuberance of vegetation and profusion of vari-colored bloom that are
so characteristic of the basin of the Meta. While lost in silent
admiration of the countless floral beauties that on every side met our
delightful gaze, we could but compare the scene to a ruined Eden,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e3826">&ldquo;Where the first sinful pair</p>
<p class="line">For consolation might have weeping trod,</p>
<p class="line">When banished from the garden of their God.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the garden adjoining our house were citrus trees
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>laden with golden fruit, bananas of many
varieties and a large mango tree, whose branches were bending under the
weight of its richly tinted, luscious drupes. Near by was a noble old
ceiba, while but a short distance away was a tall
<i>Jacaranda</i>&mdash;of the trumpet-flower family&mdash;literally
enveloped in a reddish-violet mantle of papilionaceous flowers, and
filling the air round about with perfume not unlike that of the orange
blossom or the jasmine. Everywhere we went some new floral display was
awaiting us. All along our path we found an unending variety of laurels
and myrtles; trees and shrubs and herbs of the <i>Rubiaci&aelig;</i>
family. There were splendid representatives of the genera <i>Cassia</i>
and <i>Mimosa</i>, and clumps of the ever-present moriche, together
with other species of palm equally attractive and majestic. Frequently
these were joined by delicate festoons of liana, many of which were
weighted down with orchids and epiphytes of the rarest beauty and
fragrance.</p>
<p>Orocu&eacute; is the capital of the district of that name in the
National Territory of the Meta, and the seat of a prefecture. It is
located on the left bank of the Meta, on an eminence about thirty feet
above the surface of the river, and sufficiently high to guarantee it
against inundations during the rainy season. Being less than five
degrees from the equator, the climate is warm but, during our stay, it
was never uncomfortable, and at no time did the thermometer ever rise
above 82&deg; F. The population is about six hundred. The place is
healthful, and malignant fevers are rare. The streets are wide, and
some of the houses are well-built and comfortable. Most of them are
constructed of bamboo plastered over with clay. The roof is thatched
with the broad leaves of the moriche palm or preferably with those of
the <i lang="es">palma de cobija</i>, also known as the <i lang=
"es">palma de sombrero</i>&mdash;hat palm. This is what scientists call
<i>Copernicia<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3858src" href="#xd21e3858"
name="xd21e3858src">1</a> tectorum</i>, and is preferred to any other
leaf because it is not readily inflammable. Such a roof lasts ten or
twelve years, and is impervious to water. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>During our sojourn in
Orocu&eacute; it rained regularly for several hours every day and,
although the downpour at times was very heavy, never once did we
observe a single drop of water to pass through the roof. Everything in
our rooms remained as dry as if the roofs had been made of tile or
slate.</p>
<p>Many of these bamboo-palm houses are constructed without the use of
a single nail. Studs and cross beams, laths and rafters, are tied
together and held firmly in place by bejucos, those wonderful natural
cords and cables which are found in such profusion in every tropical
forest, and which, in the hands of the natives, serves such an endless
variety of purposes.</p>
<p>Some years ago the town possessed what the inhabitants considered a
large and beautiful church. It was constructed of the same materials as
the other buildings of the town and occupied a conspicuous position on
the plaza. In consequence of recent revolutions and other disturbances,
it had been greatly neglected, and, at the time of our visit, was
rapidly falling into ruins. The people had not had a pastor for some
years, but were hoping to have one soon. They, however, received every
few months the ministrations of a priest from a neighboring mission,
and longed for the time when they could have a resident pastor and see
their church restored to its pristine condition.</p>
<p>There was a small school for boys, attended by about twenty young
mestizos, but none for girls. There was a movement on foot to secure
the services of some nuns to teach the girls, and the mothers of the
children awaited their arrival with the greatest impatience. The
<i>monjas</i>&mdash;nuns&mdash;have a wonderful influence over the
children, and young and old are thoroughly devoted to them.</p>
<p>Orocu&eacute; has an <i>aduana</i>, or customhouse, and is the
centre of a flourishing grazing district, in which there are numerous
<i>hatos</i> and <i>fundaciones</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3885src" href="#xd21e3885" name="xd21e3885src">2</a> containing
from two to twenty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span>thousand head of cattle. Cattle, hides and
rubber, together with the coffee, which is brought from the foothills
of the Andes, constitute the principal articles of export.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3909src" href="#xd21e3909" name=

<p>The neighboring Indians manufacture large and beautiful hammocks
from the leaves of the <i>Cumare</i> and other palms and bring them
here and exchange them for anything that may strike their fancy.
Although I had brought a German hammock with me, I procured one of
these Indian <i>chinchorros</i>, and found it during the remainder of
my journey in South America the best investment I could have made.
Nothing contributed more to my comfort when I desired a siesta, and
when I wished to escape the filth and insect pests to which, in my
wanderings, I was so frequently exposed.</p>
<p>Of the many objects brought to Orocu&eacute; for barter by the
Indians few had greater interest for us than the weapons employed by
them in the chase and in war. Among these the chief ones were their
poisoned arrows and blowguns. A friend made us a present of some of
them, but owing to the inconvenience of transporting them, we were
unable, much to our regret, to take them with us.</p>
<p>For a long time the mystery connected with the virulent poison,
known as curare, urari woorali, etc., with which the Indians poison
their arrows, remained unsolved, notwithstanding <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>the
efforts of men of science to determine its source and composition.
Early travelers gave the most fantastic accounts of its composition and
manufacture. According to them it was a concoction more uncanny than
that prepared from</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Eye of newt and toe of frog,</p>
<p class="line">Wool of bat and tongue of dog.</p>
<p class="line">Adder&rsquo;s fork and blind worm&rsquo;s sting,</p>
<p class="line">Lizard&rsquo;s leg and owlet&rsquo;s wing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Indeed, so carefully did the Indians engaged in its
manufacture guard the secret of its preparation that it was not until a
few decades ago that the true character of this deadly compound was
first understood. Boussingault suspected but did not prove the
existence of strychnine in curare.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3940src"
href="#xd21e3940" name="xd21e3940src">4</a> Humboldt was probably the
first to suspect its true nature.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3945src"
href="#xd21e3945" name="xd21e3945src">5</a> It is now known that
neither snake&rsquo;s teeth nor stinging ants form its active
principle, as was formerly supposed, but that its venomous properties
are due to the presence of curarine, a bitter crystalline alkaloid
obtained from the plant <i>Strychnos toxifera</i>, or other plants of
this genus, found throughout equatorial America. Its virulence is
manifested only when it is administered through the skin. It then
paralyzes the motor nerves, and, if the poison be sufficiently strong,
it produces death by suffocation.</p>
<p>The Indians in Orocu&eacute;, as everywhere else along the Meta and
Orinoco, were a subject of never-ending study for us. Most of the
inhabitants of Orocu&eacute; are Indians or mestizos, and it would be
difficult to find anywhere a gentler or more peaceful people. The town
was founded by the Salivas Indians, whose nasal language the early
missionaries found so difficult to master, but whose gentle nature and
amiable disposition were ever the subject of the highest eulogies.
Remnants of this tribe are still found in this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>territory, as are also representatives of the
Piapocas, Tunebos, Yaruros, Cuivas, and the once powerful yet friendly
Achaguas.</p>
<p>The tribe, however, that counts the greatest numbers, is the
Guahibos, whom certain imaginative travelers would have us believe are
as fierce as pumas or jaguars. The truth is, however, that, although
some of them are more or less nomadic in their habits, and decline to
live with the <i>racionales</i>&mdash;whites&mdash;they are, as a rule,
peaceful and industrious. Sr. Jorge Brisson, an engineer for the
Colombian government, who a few years ago thoroughly explored this
country&mdash;the Casanare&mdash;speaks of them as being <i lang=
"es">muy agricultores y muy trabajadores</i>&mdash;hard-working tillers
of the soil.</p>
<p>That they are peaceful and harmless is evidenced by the fact that
the owners of the scattered <i>conucos</i> along the Meta are rarely,
if ever, disturbed by these much maligned Indians. In many of the
isolated habitations, which we visited on our way up the river, we
found only women and children. The men were occupied elsewhere, and
were sometimes absent for weeks at a time. This, certainly, would not
be the case if the Guahibos were the cruel, relentless savages they are
so often represented to be. Not once in our journeyings up the Meta and
its affluents did we hear of any atrocities committed by these Indians,
or even of any complaints against them, although we took particular
pains to inform ourselves about the matter. All the reports about their
robberies and murders were confined to those we had heard a thousand
miles down the river and from people who probably never saw a Guahibo
in their lives, and who would not recognize one if they were to see
one.</p>
<p>It is true that now and then a cow or a calf may disappear from some
of the <i>Conucos</i> and <i>fundaciones</i> and that their
disappearance is always credited to the Indians. Even if this suspicion
were verified, an occasional theft of this kind&mdash;all the
circumstances considered&mdash;should not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>be so surprising. We
do not need to go beyond the boundaries of our own country to find
cases of cattle stealing. And the poor Indian, often cheated and
wronged, may, without being a casuist, easily persuade himself that he
is justified in seeking occult compensation. This is often his only
safe method of making reprisals for damage done him in person and
property, and he would be more than human, if he did not occasionally
resort to it if he thought he could do so with impunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; says Brisson, &ldquo;the poor creatures
have heretofore been very badly treated by those who claim to be
civilized, and flee in terror when they see a white man. The question
now is not to civilize them but to win their confidence. The problem
would easily be solved if this delicate task were confided to the
missionary priests. They would bring it to a successful issue much
sooner than could government officialdom.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3982src" href="#xd21e3982" name="xd21e3982src">6</a></p>
<p>Contrary to what is often imagined, the Indians who visit the
settlements along the Meta and the Orinoco are always decently if but
scantily clad. In their forest homes, however, their raiment usually
consists of a simple lap-cloth. On occasions of feasting or public
rejoicing they make an addition to their toilet. This consists in
painting their bodies with various dyes, but chiefly with the
yellowish-red annatto, which is obtained from the pulp of the fruit of
the arnotto tree, <i>Bixa Orellana</i>. They frequently cover their
persons with the most fantastic designs. Indeed, it is only when thus
decorated that the true children of the forest consider themselves
properly dressed. They would be ashamed to appear before strangers
otherwise.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3993src" href="#xd21e3993" name=
"xd21e3993src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"
name="pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Tigers and serpents,&rdquo; observes Mr. Brisson, &ldquo;are
bug-bears of the same family as <i lang="es">Indios
bravos</i>&rdquo;&mdash;savages. It is certain that the
tiger&mdash;jaguar&mdash;is fond of heifers and calves. But herdsmen
will tell you, that in order to get rid of one, it is at times
necessary to follow him for a fortnight before being able to find and
kill him. This is sufficient to prove that the tiger is never the first
to attack a man in the llanos of Casanare, where it has food in
abundance. &ldquo;Serpents are met with only casually.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4010src" href="#xd21e4010" name=
"xd21e4010src">8</a></p>
<p>I was glad to find one writer, who is so familiar with the country
as is Sr. Brisson, to speak thus of the wild beasts most dreaded and of
the still more dreaded <i>Indios bravos</i>, for it harmonized
perfectly with my own experience.</p>
<p>We were one day talking with our host in Orocu&eacute; about the
stories told by travelers and writers regarding the jaguars of the
South American forests. He smiled, and said, &ldquo;I have lived in
this country thirty-five years. I have several <i>hatos</i> in various
parts of the country, which I visit frequently. In doing this I am
obliged to travel much through the forests and plains. I have often
journeyed up and down the Orinoco, and the Meta from Trinidad to
Bogot&aacute;, and, believe me, during all these years, I have never
seen but one jaguar and that was in passing.&rdquo; How different his
experience from that of those who, after a short excursion into the
interior of South America, where they rarely leave the beaten track
used for centuries, have, nevertheless, such wonderful adventures to
relate; such miraculous escapes from savage beasts and more savage
Indians!</p>
<p>Our host was a Venezuelan of Spanish descent, and a splendid type of
the old Spanish school. He had spent <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>a part of his youth
in Germany, and was a man of education and refinement. He was untiring
in his delicate attentions to us during our sojourn in Orocu&eacute;,
and made us quite forget that we were so far from home and what we so
often fancy are the indispensable necessities of civilization. He had
been eminently successful in business. Besides owning the largest
business house in Orocu&eacute;&mdash;which is a distributing point for
the great Casanare territory&mdash;he is the proprietor of several of
the largest <i>hatos</i> in the country and counted his cattle by tens
of thousands. In addition to all this, he has various other interests
that yield him a handsome income. He enjoys the reputation of being a
millionaire, and the reputation is apparently justified.</p>
<p>How he could content himself to live in this isolated quarter of the
world&mdash;&ldquo;six months from everywhere,&rdquo; as one of his
clerks expressed it&mdash;when he could enjoy all that money could
command in the capitals of the Old or the New World, was a mystery to
us, and yet he seemed to be perfectly happy here, and to have no desire
to live elsewhere. Was it the ever dominant feeling that &ldquo;There
is no place like home,&rdquo; that made him prefer Orocu&eacute; to
Paris or London? <i>Quien sabe?</i></p>
<p>The only Europeans living here were three Germans. Two of them had
arrived but a few months before our visit, while the third had been
here for nearly twenty years. This latter was also as much attached to
Orocu&eacute; as was our host. The year before he had visited his
family and friends in Hamburg and Berlin. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I had <i lang="de">heimweh</i>&mdash;got homesick&mdash;for
Orocu&eacute;, and came back much sooner than I intended. The noise and
bustle and hurry and high-pressure of Europe were quite unendurable,
and I was more than delighted when I got back to dear old
Orocu&eacute;.&rdquo; He, too, had realized that there is no place like
home. And he, also, like our host, was educated and cultured; was
interested in science and literature and passionately fond of music. He
had several musical instruments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174"
href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>in his house&mdash;among
others a piano&mdash;on all of which he was a skillful performer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wonderful men these Germans are!&rdquo; I said to
myself, when I saw these three men in the prime of life burying
themselves away off here in the wilderness, so far away from friends
and country. But this is not an unique instance of young Germans going
to distant lands to engage in business and to contribute thereby
towards that wonderful development of trade and influence for which the
<i lang="de">Vaterland</i> is becoming so famous. In every part of
Venezuela which we visited, we found it the same. The greatest and most
successful business houses are in the hands of Germans.</p>
<p>In all parts of South America you will find Germans, and find them,
too, successful in their enterprises, and often getting more than their
share of the trade of this vast continent. But they deserve success,
for they have earned it, and know how to make sacrifices when they are
necessary to attain it, or to reach the goal for which they are
striving&mdash;to become the dominating commercial power of South
America. If the United States would display but a tithe of the energy
and enterprise exhibited by Germany, it would not now occupy in the
southern continent the humiliating position it does among the great
mercantile nations of the world, and among our friends of the great
Latin American republics. It is not too late to retrieve our loss, but,
to do so, we must change our policy and our methods of doing business,
and conduct them along the lines recommended by such alert and
far-seeing statesmen as Blaine, Root and Roosevelt.</p>
<p>After a delightful week spent in Orocu&eacute; we were ready to
start for Barrigon or Puerto Nuevo on the Rio Humea, an affluent of the
Meta. To go there by a <i>bongo</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4053src"
href="#xd21e4053" name="xd21e4053src">9</a> during <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>the
rapidly rising water, would require from fifteen to twenty days. It
would be necessary to pole it&mdash;or pull it along by ropes in
certain places&mdash;the entire distance. Besides this, owing to its
limited quarters, such a boat would be extremely uncomfortable.
Fortunately for us, and thanks to the kind offices of our host, we were
able to have the use of a fine and commodious petroleum launch, which
would convey us to our destination in a week.</p>
<p>It was with genuine regret that we said <i>Adios</i> to the good
people of Orocu&eacute; and to the kind friends who had made our
sojourn there so pleasant and profitable. They were all at the landing
to see us off, and speed the parting guests with the touching words,
<i>Vayan Uds. Con Dios</i>&mdash;May you go with God. To these fervent
words of farewell came from our little crew the cordial response, <i>Y
con la Virgen</i>, and with the Virgin Mother.</p>
<p>Our captain was a bright and courteous and most obliging young
Colombian from Bogot&aacute;. The pilot was a Venezuelan half-breed
from the town of Barcelona. This &ldquo;son of Barcelona,&rdquo; as he
described himself, had fled from his native country, on account of the
continued revolutions, to seek peace in Orocu&eacute;. The cook was
also a mestizo, while his assistant was a strong, broad-shouldered
Guahibo, who, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>far from being an unfeeling savage, was one of
the kindest and most thoughtful persons one could meet. He was ever
ready to serve us and was never more happy than when he observed that
his delicate attentions were fully appreciated.</p>
<p>The launch&rsquo;s commissariat consisted of a liberal supply of
<i>tasajo</i>&mdash;salt, dried beef&mdash;cassava bread, coffee,
<i>panela</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e4111src" href="#xd21e4111"
name="xd21e4111src">10</a> and various kinds of fruit. Anticipating our
needs at this part of our journey we had, before leaving the
Port-of-Spain, laid in a supply of claret and canned goods of various
kinds. Aside from the butter and condensed cream and some of the fruit
preserves, the canned goods were a disappointment. Although they were
guaranteed to be fresh from the factory, they were unfit for use. What
we really enjoyed more than anything else, and always found fresh and
wholesome, was our supply of coffee, sugar and crackers. For our
<i>caf&eacute;</i> in the morning nothing more was desired.</p>
<p>Coffee was always served on the launch, when we were ready to start
on the day&rsquo;s journey, which was usually at sunrise. <i lang=
"es">Desayuno</i>&mdash;breakfast&mdash;we took at about ten
o&rsquo;clock. For this we always landed, as it was more convenient and
more agreeable to do our cooking on shore than aboard. It was, indeed,
quite romantic to have one&rsquo;s breakfast served under a
broad-spreading ceiba, or in the midst of a clump of stately palms, or
in the shade of a group of graceful bamboos. And not the least
picturesque feature about it was Antonio&mdash;our ever-active and
obliging Guahibo.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4126width" id="p176"><img src="images/p176.jpg"

width="720" height="462">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">&ldquo;La Ni&ntilde;ita,&rdquo;
Our Launch, on the Upper Meta.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Whenever possible, we stopped for <i lang="es">desayuno</i> and
<i lang="es">comida</i>&mdash;dinner&mdash;at a hut or cottage on the
river&rsquo;s bank. We ordinarily passed several of them in the course
of the day, for the banks of the upper Meta count many more inhabitants
than does the lower part of the river. Usually there was only a single
cottage, but occasionally we passed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>a <i lang=
"es">caserio</i> consisting of five or six cottages. But whatever the
number they were always of the simplest construction possible.
Sometimes the house was nothing more than a palm-thatched shed,
composed solely of a roof, with eaves extending almost to the ground,
resting on short supports. Sometimes the owners of these humble
habitations were Indians, sometimes mestizos. But whether Indians or
mestizos, we were cordially received and invited to make ourselves
comfortable in the best hammock in their possession. With them the
<i lang="es">hamaca</i> is the one indispensable article of furniture
in every dwelling, even the poorest. It takes the place of our
rocking-chair, sofa and bed. According to the Colombian poet, Madrid,
the hammock was invented by the Indians&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e3826">&ldquo;Gente</p>
<p class="line">Dulce, benigna y mansa,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&mdash;a race suave, gentle and benign&mdash;and even
when all else fails them they have their hammock to comfort them in
misfortune, banishing their trouble in its oblivious embrace. The poet,
like many others, evidently shares the Indian&rsquo;s fondness for the
hammock, as the best verses he ever wrote was his poem <i lang="es">La
Hamaca</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4157src" href="#xd21e4157" name=
"xd21e4157src">11</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href=
"#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>There were several reasons for stopping at one of these native huts
when we could conveniently do so. We were thus enabled to get fresh
fruit, eggs and chickens, and have them cooked as well. We had no
complaint to make of our own cooks, but we soon discovered that the
Indian and mestizo women were far better. I shall never forget our
surprise and pleasure at the manner in which a young Indian woman
prepared for us roast chicken, and that, too, in a remarkably short
time. I never tasted a more tender or better flavored fowl in the best
restaurants of New York or Paris. And she had no stove or oven in which
to roast it. Her sole utensil was a wooden spit over a few coals
surrounded by three stones about seven or eight inches in diameter. And
all was as clean as it was enjoyable.</p>
<p>All the furniture of the house is as primitive as the fireplace on
which the meals are cooked. Often the only utensils of metal are a pot,
or kettle, and a machete, which takes the place of a knife in cutting.
When the hammock is not used one sits on the ground or on a log that
serves as a bench. Occasionally we were offered the carapace of a large
turtle in lieu of a chair. When the hammock is not used, an ox hide, or
a rush mat, or a large palm leaf serves as a bed. Often the poor people
sleep on the bare ground.</p>
<p>Aside from the single metal kettle above mentioned, all other
culinary utensils are made from the fruit of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>calabash tree. It is the species known to
botanists as <i>Crescentia Cujete</i> and is called by the natives
<i>totumo</i>. The fruit is used at various stages of its growth
according as it is employed for making small or large utensils. The
younger and smaller fruits are fashioned into spoons, those of medium
size serve for drinking vessels, while the largest full-grown
fruits&mdash;often eight inches in diameter&mdash;are used for dishes
and platters.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4208src" href="#xd21e4208"
name="xd21e4208src">12</a> They also furnish a kind of musical
instrument resembling the castanet. But marvelous to relate, they are
also employed for lanterns of a most original kind. After the shell is
pierced with a large number of small holes it is filled with those
wonderful <i>Cocuios</i>&mdash;fireflies&mdash;that are found in such
numbers in the tropics. Such a lantern seen at a distance is not unlike
the familiar Chinese lantern, and, considering the nature of the
illuminant, gives a surprising amount of light.</p>
<p>A house, such as the one just described, is the lodging place of the
dogs, and poultry, and not infrequently of the pigs also. The poultry
roost upon the crosspieces immediately under the roof. The other
animals occupy their own corner, and no one seems to be molested by
their presence. Benzoni, in speaking of the habits of the Indians he
saw, remarks in his quaint fashion: &ldquo;They all sleep together like
fowls, some on the ground and some suspended in the
air.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4216src" href="#xd21e4216" name=
"xd21e4216src">13</a></p>
<p>Every house is surrounded by a number of fruit trees. Among these
the <i>platano</i> and the banana are the most conspicuous, and are
never wanting, for they supply a large part of the food of the
inhabitants of the tropics. Equally important are maize and
yuca.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4230src" href="#xd21e4230" name=
"xd21e4230src">14</a> The latter is used for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>making bread. In certain parts of the tropics no
other kind of bread is obtainable. To me it has a very insipid taste,
somewhat like that of bran or cellulose. Schomburgk considered that it
had a deleterious effect on the stomach, but there are few, I think,
that share his view. Certain it is, that its use as food is universal
in the tropics, and it is one of the three plants&mdash;yuca, maize and
the platano&mdash;that one is always sure to find in every
conuco&mdash;even that of the poorest Indian. These three articles are
his staff of life. The natives also eat fish and flesh of various
kinds, it is true, but as the three plant products named are quite
sufficient to sustain life, and as they require little care after they
are once planted, many people make little or no effort to secure other
kinds of food. They are content with little and seem to enjoy the
living of the simple life fully as much as some of our friends in the
North enjoy talking and writing about it.</p>
<p>Often, too, where one would least expect it, one will find beautiful
flower gardens around the most unpretentious habitations. Of the
flowers that we in the North are most familiar with&mdash;not to
mention countless peculiarly tropical species&mdash;those we most
frequently observed were roses, jasmines, dahlias, pinks, violets,
dracenas, gladioli and gardenias. The large rose bushes, or rather rose
trees&mdash;they are so huge&mdash;one sometimes sees in the hot, dry
climate of the tropics are truly remarkable. They sometimes attain a
height of twenty feet, and one may count on a single bush as many as a
thousand buds. From such a bush one may pluck a hundred beautiful roses
every day in the year without any apparent diminution in the number on
the parent stem.</p>
<p>While journeying up the Orinoco and Meta, we several times tried our
luck at fishing, but our efforts were always attended with the most
ignominious failures. Outside of a few minnows we caught absolutely
nothing. One of our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181"
name="pb181">181</a>]</span>crew once caught a fish about two feet long
resembling a pickerel and this was the only time that we ever tasted
fresh fish all the time we were on the river.</p>
<p>No sooner had the hook sunk into the water than the bait was taken.
There was a momentary nibble, and presto! the bait had disappeared. On
investigation we found that we had to deal with the terrible
Caribe&mdash;that voracious little fish about which so many
extraordinary stories are related. In crossing rivers the natives dread
the attacks of this serrasalmonine marauder more than they do the
gymnotus, the stingray or the cayman. They have very sharp, trenchant
teeth, usually swim in schools, and, when attracted by blood, will
attack men and the larger animals without hesitation. And so fierce and
rapid is their combined action that their attack usually means death to
the victim.</p>
<p>We had often heard and read of their snapping fishhooks in twain but
had classed this statement among the stories of the monkey-bridge
class&mdash;stories that entertained us during our early school days,
and which, I doubt not, still perform the same function for the rising
generation in certain parts of the world.</p>
<p>But, while pondering our ill success with rod and line, we
discovered one evening, after vainly trying for an hour to get at least
one specimen of the finny tribe&mdash;and exhausting all our bait in
the attempt&mdash;that our hook&mdash;a good-sized one, too&mdash;was
snapped in two as neatly as if it had been cut by a pair of pliers. We
examined the part of the hook that remained attached to the line and we
found that it was actually cut, not broken on account of defective
material.</p>
<p>On further inquiry, I found that several men of science who had
visited these parts, and had, presumably, investigated the matter, had
positively stated that the Caribe was capable of severing fishhooks
with the greatest ease. Thus Mr. H. M. Myers does not hesitate to
affirm that the Caribe is &ldquo;able to sever ordinary hooks as if
they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>but slender threads,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4256src" href="#xd21e4256" name="xd21e4256src">15</a> and Dr.
Carl Sachs declares that &ldquo;even thick steel fishhooks do not
withstand their teeth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4261src" href=
"#xd21e4261" name="xd21e4261src">16</a></p>
<p>Both in the Orinoco and in the Meta we saw quite a number of
porpoises&mdash;<i>toninas</i>, the Spaniards call them&mdash;quite as
large and as playful as any we ever saw in the ocean. The natives say
they are the friends of man, and defend him from caymans when he
happens to be in the river.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4271src" href=
"#xd21e4271" name="xd21e4271src">17</a> One thing is certain and that
is that caymans and crocodiles both quickly make their escape when the
porpoise appears. It is probably, because the sluggish and indolent
caymans, ferocious as they are by nature, have an instinctive dread of
the noisy and impetuous evolutions of these delphinine cetaceans,
especially when they move in schools.</p>
<p>We were often surprised by the large flocks of ducks, of many
different species, which we saw along the Meta. They seemed to be most
numerous near sunset when, occasionally, they flew across the river by
thousands. So great, indeed, was their number at times that we could
compare them only with the immense flocks of pigeons that, during our
boyhood days, used to darken the sky during their season of migration.
Many of these ducks, as articles of food, compare favorably with our
mallard and canvasback. Truth to tell, the only time we regretted not
having a shotgun with us was when we saw these clouds of edible birds
passing over our heads within easy reach. This was particularly the
case when our food supply was running short, or when we desired a
change of diet, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span>something different from <i lang="es">carne
frita</i>&mdash;fried beef that has been salted and dried&mdash;and
sancocho.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4281src" href="#xd21e4281" name=
"xd21e4281src">18</a></p>
<p>Among the singing birds peculiar to the tropics are two that deserve
special mention. There are the campanero or bellbird, and the flautero
or flute bird.</p>
<p>Of the bellbird, Waterson writes as follows: &ldquo;He is about the
size of a jay. His plumage is white as snow. On his forehead rises a
spiral tube nearly three inches long. It is jet black, dotted all over
with small white feathers. It has a communication with the palate, and
when filled with air, looks like a spire; when empty it becomes
pendulous. His note is loud and clear, like the sound of a bell.</p>
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;With many of the feathered race, he pays the common tribute
of a morning and an evening song; and even when the meridian sun has
shut in silence the mouths of the whole of animated nature, the
campanero still cheers the forest. You hear his toll, and then a pause
for a minute, then another toll, and then a pause again, and then a
toll, and again a pause. Then he is silent for six or eight minutes and
then another toll, and so on. Acteon would stop in mid-chase, Maria
would defer her evening song and Orpheus himself would drop his lute
and listen to him; so sweet, so novel, and romantic is the toll of the
pretty snow-white campanero.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4296src"
href="#xd21e4296" name="xd21e4296src">19</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>So closely indeed does the note of the campanero resemble the sound
of a bell that the traveler can easily fancy that there is a chapel in
the depths of the forest, and that the faithful are being called to
prayer. The bellbird has a near relative in the herrero, or blacksmith
bird, whose note is like that produced when an anvil is struck by a
hammer.</p>
<p>The flautero, or flute bird, is quite small and of a grayish color.
Its notes are surprisingly sweet and mellow, and closely resemble those
of a sweet-toned flute, whence its name. One who hears this feathered
songster for the first time would easily believe that he is listening
to a skillful flute player, and not to the song of a tiny bird. The
refrain of its song is fairly well expressed in the following
notes:</p>
<div class="figure xd21e4316width"><img src="images/music.png" alt=
"Music notation" width="587" height="77"></div>
<p>Unfortunately for us, we were often obliged to listen to sounds that
were not so agreeable as those of the flautero or campanero. These were
the raucous, discordant, never-ending noises produced by frogs and
toads. In Orocu&eacute; they always began their cacophonous serenade at
nightfall, and kept it up uninterruptedly until the following morning.
I could then realize that Padre Rivero had good cause for regarding
them as among the greatest nuisances with which he had to contend.
Their confused, strident notes&mdash;base, tenor, contralto,
soprano&mdash;kept up the entire night were, he assures us, enough to
split one&rsquo;s head. Some of these amphibians we heard at
Orocu&eacute; were on the opposite side of the river from us, more than
half a mile distant. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>were in very truth what Lowell has
so well characterized as</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Old croakers, deacons of the mire,</p>
<p class="line">That led the deep batrachian choir.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The wonderful depth and fertility of the dark, loamy
soil in the valley of the Meta was ever a source of wonder to us. Along
the river banks it usually formed a layer of four or five feet, and not
infrequently seven or eight feet. And the vegetation was everywhere an
evidence of this fertility. At Platanales, a <i>conuco</i> at which we
spent a night, we saw a grove of several acres of the largest and most
prolific bananas and plantains we had ever encountered anywhere. At
another <i>conuco</i>, farther up the river, where we stopped for
breakfast, we saw several acres of corn that was rapidly maturing. And
what corn! Never did I in Kansas or Nebraska see such ample stalks or
so large ears and grains. It was a revelation to us, and exhibited in a
most striking manner the wonderful, future possibilities of this
marvelously fertile, yet unknown land.</p>
<p>Near every dwelling, however humble, along the Meta, we observed a
large cross made of tastefully and often artistically plaited palm
leaves. The material was yet quite fresh and the crosses had evidently
been erected only a few days before we passed by. In design and
workmanship they reminded us of those seen in parts of Italy on Palm
Sunday. On inquiry, we found that they had been erected on the third of
May, the feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is this cross placed here?&rdquo; I asked of an Indian
woman, while she was preparing our <i>desayuno</i>. &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Para que no nos pegue el chubasco</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;in order that
the <i>chubasco</i>&mdash;wind squall&mdash;may not strike us, she
replied without hesitation. I asked many others at divers places the
same question and invariably received a similar reply.</p>
<p>These poor people were not able to erect the beautiful shrines one
so frequently sees in the Catholic countries of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>Europe, and so their simple faith found
expression in these palm-leaf crosses, on which they had evidently put
their best and most careful work, of which they often seemed justly
proud.</p>
<p>On passing by a particularly large and beautiful cross of this kind
my mind reverted to a shrine near the lighthouse of Savona, an ancient
town near Genoa. Here there is a statue of the Madonna, twelve feet
high, under which are inscribed two Sapphic verses, expressing in
rhythmic numbers the same idea that was uppermost in the mind of the
good Indian woman when she braided and placed in position this symbol
of redemption. The verses were composed by Gabriello Chiabrera,
&ldquo;the prince of Italian lyric poets,&rdquo; who was a native of
Savona. They are remarkable in that they are both &ldquo;good Latin and
choice Italian,&rdquo; and have the same meaning in both languages.
They read as follows:</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In mare irato, in subita procella,</p>
<p class="line">Invoco te, nostra benigna stella.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4362src" href="#xd21e4362" name=
"xd21e4362src">20</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">The only place of any importance between Orocu&eacute;
and Barrig&oacute;n is Cabuyaro, a small town of about two hundred
inhabitants. It cherishes the hope of becoming the eastern terminus of
the long-projected railroad from Bogot&aacute; to the Meta. This would
no doubt be a good terminal point, as the town is favorably located,
and the river is sufficiently deep to permit the passage of good-sized
vessels. As at the other towns we passed, the steamer may moor within a
few feet of the river&rsquo;s bank.</p>
<p>Cabuyaro, however, is not the only place ambitious to become the
terminus of the Bogot&aacute; Eastern railroad. It has several rivals,
some of which are little more at present than rude huts in the
wilderness. Among these is <span class="corr" id="xd21e4377" title=
"Source: Barig&oacute;n">Barrig&oacute;n</span>, which also rejoices in
the high-sounding name of Puerto Nuevo. It has, certainly, an advantage
over <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>Cabuyaro in that it is much nearer the capital.
When this railway, which has been in contemplation for many years,
shall have been completed, it will be possible to go from Bogot&aacute;
to the Meta in ten hours. At present it takes six days to make the
trip, and a very trying and tiresome one it is.</p>
<p>While our cooks were preparing <i>comida</i>&mdash;dinner&mdash;we
visited the town. As we were passing a neat-looking house on the plaza,
next to the church, a woman standing at the door, surrounded by her
family, observing that we were strangers, insisted on our partaking of
the hospitality of her home. She gave orders at once to have dinner
prepared for us, and was deeply disappointed when she learned that our
captain had made arrangements for us to dine elsewhere. She then said:
&ldquo;You must do us the honor of taking at least a cup of coffee in
our humble home. We cannot let you depart without something.&rdquo;
Before she had finished speaking, one of her daughters, a bright,
modest girl of about sixteen, had started to boil the water, and in a
short time we were served with as good coffee as we had ever tasted
anywhere during our journey.</p>
<p>The kindness and simplicity of these good people were admirable.
They were much interested in our journey, and could not understand what
could induce us to undertake such a long trip. They were most eager to
hear about our own country, and showed an intelligent interest in
persons and things that quite surprised us. Soon a number of their
neighbors called and each one was duly presented to the
<i>viajeros</i>&mdash;travelers&mdash;and served also with a cup of the
aromatic beverage which our hostess knew so well how to prepare.
Although we had become accustomed to the generous hospitality of the
good people we had everywhere met along the Meta, the cordial reception
given us by the people of Cabuyaro during our short stay among them
impressed us in a special manner, and made us feel that it is
particularly among primitive peoples, among those in the depth of the
forest, or in the solitude of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>desert, that hospitality is
not only regarded as a duty but is also esteemed a pleasure.</p>
<p>How often, when partaking of the simple fare of our kindly hosts in
tropical America, were we forced to compare their never-failing
hospitality with that of the Greeks of Homeric times! Then nothing was
too good for the honored guest, for he might be a god in disguise, or,
if not a god, he was at least a friend of the gods. Like the early
Christians, who treated their guests as if they might be angels who had
come upon them unawares, our Meta hosts always gave us the best at
their disposition, and expressed their regret that they were unable to
do more. Their home was ours as long as we chose to remain, and their
every act showed that they were pleased to be honored&mdash;as they
expressed it&mdash;by the strangers&rsquo; visit.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4396src" href="#xd21e4396" name="xd21e4396src">21</a></p>
<p>Before leaving Orocu&eacute;, we had telegraphed to Villavicencio to
have saddle and pack mules ready for us on our arrival in
Barrig&oacute;n, which, as planned, was to be the morning after our
arrival at Cabuyaro. As, however, we had been delayed a day by trouble
with the engine, and loss of our anchor, we could not hope to reach our
destination without traveling all night. Fortunately, there was a full
moon and a cloudless night. And our crew, the captain notably, were
ready and willing, regardless of their own comfort, to do anything in
their power to enable us to reach Barrig&oacute;n at the appointed
time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>Never shall I forget our last night on the Meta. C. and I were
sitting on the prow of our launch, which was moving merrily along the
broad river&mdash;as broad as ever, apparently&mdash;which, under the
bright rays of the moon, shone like molten silver. There was no murky
vapor to obscure the fair face of the queen of night, or dim her
glowing form. Surrounded by the myriad stars of heaven, she reigned
supreme. Then, more truly than ever before in our lives, could we say
with Saint Augustine, that we saw &ldquo;the moon and stars solace the
night.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4435src" href="#xd21e4435"
name="xd21e4435src">22</a></p>
<p>The air was balmy and impregnated with sweetest perfumes and rarest
balsamic odors, wafted from the dark, impervious forest walls that rose
in silent majesty on either shore. The sleeping mimosas that had folded
their leaves for the night, the ethereal jambos, figs, and laurels, the
dark crowns of the jaca and the manga, the slender shafts of bamboo
tufts, the dim crests of the palm, trellised vines and liana festoons,
defiled before us in rapid succession, and, in the shades of night,
assumed the most fantastic shapes and magic combinations.</p>
<p>As we glided along the glassy stretches of the river there was
nothing to mar the perfect stillness that pervaded the scene, except
the muffled pulsations of our engine, too feeble to wake an echo from
the neighboring banks. The time, the place, the freshness of earth and
the splendor of heaven lent themselves to reverie, and stirred the
fancy to unwonted activity. Frequently on the Orinoco we had amused
ourselves by watching the odd and whimsical shapes assumed by the
clouds, <span class="corr" id="xd21e4447" title=
"Source: epecially">especially</span> before or after a
<i>chubasco</i>, or at the time the sun was dropping below the horizon.
Then the imagination, quickened to action, would discover, in the
rapidly changing clouds, animal forms varying from the bear and the
eagle to the griffin and the dragon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p>And so it was now. At one time we could see, in a curiously arranged
clump of trees and vines, the ruins of a Rhenish castle, at another the
shattered towers and merloned walls of an enchanted palace. Now it was
a rustic chapel by the wayside, and a moment later, as we peered into
the darkness of the inner wold, and noted the huge dark tree trunks, it
was the massive pillars of a Hindoo shrine. Here it was a Druid
trysting-place, there a mermaid&rsquo;s grot and there again a
dryad&rsquo;s bower or the home of a fairy queen. That Titania was not
far distant was evidenced by the swarms of fairies&mdash;matter-of-fact
scientific men would doubtless call them
<i>Pyropheri</i>&mdash;fireflies&mdash;that, like a thousand stars,
flitted through the bloom and the foliage, illuming with their soft
radiance the favorite haunt of fairyland.</p>
<p>How we enjoyed the mystery of these vast solitudes! How exquisite
the ever-changing chiaroscuro; the wondrous play of light and shade;
the warmth, depth and softness of the noble pictures that, at every
turn, ravished our delighted gaze! How it all elevated the soul and
enjoined recollection of spirit! The impression was in an eminent
degree like that experienced beneath the sombre arches of a Gothic
cathedral. And why not? Were we not beneath the starry vault of heaven,
in the depth of the dark, majestic tropical forest, in the most
inspiring temple of the Most High?</p>
<p>When in Orocu&eacute;, we were told that, on a bright, clear day,
the Andes were visible from that place. But owing to the clouds and the
mists and the forests that had constantly obstructed our view, we had
not yet gotten even a glimpse of this world-famed chain of mountains.
Of course, we had seen one of its spurs in the coast range of
Venezuela. But this range was not the Cordillera of our boyhood dreams.
We longed to see that massive chain that extends in unbroken continuity
from Panama to Patagonia. And day by day, as we moved westward, our
wistful eyes were ever peering through broken forest or over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>grass-covered glade, to catch the first view of
<i lang="es">La Cordillera de los Andes</i>.</p>
<p>While silently sitting on the prow of our launch admiring the
countless, ever-changing beauties of that marvelous moonlight
night&mdash;our last on the Meta,&mdash;giving free rein to our fancy,
and shifting our course as the meandering river demanded, behold!
Suddenly like a vision, the Andes stood before us in all their majesty
and glory, looming up to the very heavens. So instant was the
apparition that, for a while, we were quite speechless from admiration
and awe. &ldquo;The Andes!&rdquo; one of us ejaculated, and we were
then completely under their magic spell. So agreeable was our surprise
and so great our emotion that for a time it was impossible to find
words to express our feelings of delight and wonder. We realized, as
probably never before, what a feeble instrument language is for
conveying one&rsquo;s innermost thoughts, and how inadequate to express
what deeply stirs the soul.</p>
<p>Our adjectives and exclamations were little more than the
Indian&rsquo;s grunt, and less devotional than the Moslem&rsquo;s
phrase, &ldquo;Allah is great!&rdquo; Coming from the cold and tame
nature of the North to that of the glorious and marvelous equator, we
were like Plato&rsquo;s men, bred in cavern twilight, and then suddenly
exposed to the bright effulgence of the noonday sun. We saw things
wonderful and unspeakable, but all our superlatives were inarticulate
and feeble, matched with the scene before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what are those lights on the mountain summit, a little to
the left?&rdquo; inquired C., finally breaking the long-sustained
silence. On the very crest of the Cordilleras and extending for a
considerable distance, was a large number of brilliant lights, like so
many electric arcs. It was as if the long rows of arc lamps that
illumine the Bay of Naples, as one sees them from an incoming steamer,
were raised skyward far above the cone of Vesuvius; or as if the
resplendent &ldquo;White Way&rdquo; of New York were lifted into
cloudland. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>At first we thought it was a forest fire, but it was so different
from the unsteady, yellowish-red flame of burning trees and vegetation.
We had seen such fires along the Orinoco and Meta&mdash;as well as
elsewhere&mdash;and were quite familiar with their appearance. It could
not be due to volcanic action, for there were no volcanoes in that
direction, unless of extremely recent origin. Besides, the lights
before us were quite different from the fitful reflections that molten
lava produces from swirling masses of vapor. Might they not actually be
the electric lights of Bogot&aacute; or of some other city of the
Sierras? No, for Bogot&aacute; was on the west slope of the mountain
range, and there was no town of any size on the eastern declivity.
Still less could the lights be due to reflection from the sun, for it
had set hours before.</p>
<p>What then was this &ldquo;midnight gloom still blossoming into
fire&rdquo;? Our curiosity was excited to a high degree, but the
apparition seemed to defy all attempts at explanation. We thought of
the gleaming light seen by Robert Bruce from the turrets of Brodick
Castle, in the isle of Arran, before his landing in Carrick.</p>
<p>We recalled a similar phenomenon, observed by Humboldt on the Cerro
del Cuchivano in Venezuela, in which he thought the luminous display
observed might be due to the burning of hydrogen and other inflammable
gases.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4482src" href="#xd21e4482" name=
"xd21e4482src">23</a></p>
<p>The Indians who live among or near the mountains, relate many
wonderful stories about strange lights that are occasionally seen on or
in the vicinity of the loftier peaks. &ldquo;It is a curious
thing,&rdquo; writes Im Thurn, regarding a phenomenon of this kind,
seen in the mountains of British Guiana, &ldquo;that, as I have seen,
there actually is an appearance, as of fire, to be seen sometimes up in
these mountains, nor was I ever able to form any theory as to its
cause.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4490src" href="#xd21e4490"
name="xd21e4490src">24</a></p>
<p>Sir Martin Conway records a more remarkable case of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>this
character. &ldquo;Long after the sun had set and darkness had come on,
Illampu glowed red like fire, and all the people in town saw it. Such a
sight none had ever beheld. In great terror they ran to the church and
the bells were rung. They thought the end of the world had
come.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4499src" href="#xd21e4499"
name="xd21e4499src">25</a></p>
<p>My own conclusion regarding the luminous phenomena, that occupied
our attention for at least an hour, during the night to which I refer,
is that they were of electric origin. The mountain in front of us
seemed to be a vast condenser from which the electricity was escaping
by a silent glow or brush-discharge on an immense scale. The color and
the steadiness of the lights, as well as their durability, were
evidence of this. They were probably of the same nature as the
corposant of St. Elmo&rsquo;s fire, sometimes seen on the spars or
yards of a ship.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4512src" href="#xd21e4512"
name="xd21e4512src">26</a></p>
<p>We slept little that last night on the Meta. Earth and sky were so
beautiful, and there was so much to engage our attention that it was a
late hour before we sought repose.</p>
<p>Early in the morning we left the Meta and entered the Humea, passing
the Rio Negro on our left. In Europe or America these two affluents of
the Meta would be considered good-sized rivers. Both of them are
navigable for some distance, but like hundreds of other rivers in South
America, are practically unknown, except to those who live in their
immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock our pilot blew a loud, prolonged blast on
his conch which served him for a horn or call-instrument, and, looking
ahead of us, we saw gathered on the banks the entire population of
Barrig&oacute;n&mdash;a negro woman, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>her three daughters
and a young man, likewise a negro. We expected, of course, to see also
our mules and our arrieros&mdash;muleteers&mdash;but they were nowhere
visible. They evidently had not arrived. To describe our disappointment
and dismay would be impossible. We felt as if we were about to be
marooned, or left in a penal colony. What did it all mean? <span class=

<i>Bongo</i>, <i>falca</i>, and <i>curiara</i> are names given in
Colombia and Venezuela to the dugouts or canoes fashioned from a single
tree-trunk. They are sometimes large enough to hold from twenty to
twenty five persons. Usually, however, their capacity is limited to
five or six persons. The curiara is smaller than the bongo or falca.
The bongo is generally provided with a covering in the centre called a
<i>toldo</i> or <i>carroza</i>. This is made of lattice-work with palm
leaves to shelter the traveler from the sun and rain. It is steered and
urged backwards and forwards by a man standing at the stern, who uses a
kind of oar&mdash;<i>canalete</i>&mdash;very much as a Venetian
gondolier handles his oar for steering and propelling his gondola. When
the current does not permit the use of oars those standing near the
prow urge the boat forward by poles called <i>palancas</i>. The boatmen
are called <i>bogas</i> and the ropes with which they sometimes pull
their canoes forward are called <i>sogas</i>. The bongo, especially
when the river is high, is a very slow means of locomotion. And owing
to the very limited space of the toldo, even in the largest canoes,
traveling in a bongo is, at best, very confining and uncomfortable. A
journey any distance in one of these long, narrow, crank
dug-outs&mdash;more unstable than a shell&mdash;is a trying experience,
and one that all travelers in equatorial America avoid whenever
possible. The treacherous craft is liable to capsize when one least
expects it. Even a skilled Oxford or Harvard sculler would at times
have great difficulty in keeping his balance in one of
them.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e4053src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="footnote">Mention is made of hammocks by Vespucci and Alonso
de Ojeda as early as 1498. They are made on hand-looms from the fibres
of various species of palm and bromelia or from cotton thread. In their
manufacture the Indian women often display considerable skill and
taste. This is particularly true of the hammocks made in the regions of
the upper Rio Negro, which are beautifully decorated with the feathers
of parrots, toucans and other birds of brilliant plumage.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;The hammock,&rdquo; as Schomburgk well
observes, &ldquo;is the most indispensable article in the
Indian&rsquo;s house, or for an Indian&rsquo;s journey. On his travels
it is carried folded up and slung round his neck; the greatest
precaution is used to prevent its getting wet. Where a halt is made, be
it of ever so short a duration, the first object sought for is a
convenient tree from which he can suspend it. It is a compliment paid
to the stranger, if the host takes the hammock from him on entering the
house and slings it for his guest, and it is the duty of the wife to do
this service for her husband. The common hammocks of the Indians are
generally open, that is, not closely woven, and colored red with roucou

<h2 class="main">THE LLANOS OF COLOMBIA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">No sooner had our launch reached the landing place,
than we bounded ashore, eager for information about our mules and their
drivers. We asked the sable matron who, with her equally sable
daughters, waited at the brink to greet us, if the mules had come. She
replied laconically, &ldquo;No, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you
heard anything about them?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is there anyone here,&rdquo; and I glanced at the swarthy youth
hard by, &ldquo;that would be willing, if well rewarded, to go forward
and hasten the arrival of men and mules?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
Se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was to be done? We could not continue our journey alone and
afoot, even if we were disposed to leave our baggage behind us. And it
soon became evident that it would not be safe to remain long at
Barrig&oacute;n. There was but one rude hut there, and that was
surrounded by mud and pools of water covered by &ldquo;Spawn, weeds and
<span class="corr" id="xd21e4538" title="Source: fifth">filth</span>
and leprous-scum&rdquo;&mdash;certainly not a very inviting place to
abide any length of time.</p>
<p>Besides, the family had nothing to eat, at least they said they had
not, except a few platanos, and these they required for their own use.
We had almost exhausted the supply we had brought from Trinidad, and
the little that was still left, we intended for our three-days trip to
Villavicencio. We were not sure that we could get anything on the way,
and we did not wish to run any risk of being without food where it
might be most needed.</p>
<p>Something had to be done, and that quickly, if we did not wish to
expose ourselves to the pangs of hunger and the danger of fever in that
filthy, miasmatic hole. In the dry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196"
href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>season, we might return to
Cabuyaro, where we could secure horses or mules, and go thence to our
next objective point, Villavicencio. During the rainy season, however,
this was impossible. We had been told the night before, that several of
the ca&ntilde;os and rivers between Cabuyaro and Villavicencio were
quite impassable, as there were neither bridges nor ferries, and that
the currents were so swift that it was quite out of the question for
man or beast to cross them by swimming.</p>
<p>We were certainly in a quandary, if not in a very serious
predicament. It was useless to go backwards, unless we wished to return
to Orocu&eacute;, and thence to Trinidad. Even <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e4549" title="Source: of">if</span> we returned to Orocu&eacute;,
we could not get a steamer down the river for several months, and to
make the long trip to Ciudad Bolivar in a bongo was not to be thought
of. We were confronted by the first really grave difficulty of our
journey, and when we considered all the circumstances, it was enough to
depress the stoutest heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why had not our men and mules arrived,<span class="corr"
id="xd21e4554" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> we asked ourselves
time and again?<a id="xd21e4557" name="xd21e4557"></a> Our telegram
ordering them had been received and satisfactorily answered. Just
before leaving Orocu&eacute; we had sent a second telegram advising our
vaqueano&mdash;guide&mdash;when he should meet us but we had not
awaited a reply, taking it for granted that there would be no hitch in
our plans. It now occurred that we had acted unwisely in not waiting
for a response to our second telegram, so as to be sure that it had
been received and was properly understood.</p>
<p>The telegraph line to Orocu&eacute; had only recently been put
up&mdash;just a few weeks before our arrival there&mdash;and had never
been in satisfactory working order. In fact, owing to a break in the
wire, which lasted a fortnight, we had not been able to get into
communication with Villavicencio&mdash;the place whence our mules were
to come&mdash;until a few days before we started for Barrig&oacute;n.
Might there not have been another interruption in the line after we
sent our second message? And did this message ever reach <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>its
destination? It is true that a week had elapsed since our departure
from Orocu&eacute;, and, if the line had been severed, it might have
been repaired.</p>
<p>But then again this was far from certain. The wire passed through
dense and interminable forests&mdash;where there were no roads of any
kind&mdash;and it might require several days to reach the break after
it was located. And then after our vaqueano got our telegram it would
require three days for him to go from Villavicencio to Barrig&oacute;n,
supposing that he had the mules and saddles in readiness. If they were
not ready there would be another delay in starting. Altogether the
outlook was far from reassuring. Our animals and men might arrive at
any hour, and then again we might be obliged to wait for them for
weeks.</p>
<p>While occupied in these far from comforting reflections, we
remembered that the mail from Bogot&aacute; to Orocu&eacute; was due.
The men who would bring it would also bring a certain amount of freight
for various points on the Meta. Here, then, was a ray of hope. If our
own men and animals should fail us, we might be able to prevail on the
mail carriers to give us the necessary means of transportation for
ourselves and baggage. This consideration tended to relieve somewhat
the suspense which was the most unpleasant feature of our hapless
situation. We resolved, accordingly, to take a more optimistic view of
things, and to trust to our star which, so far, had ever been in the
ascendant.</p>
<p>What had greatly contributed to the gloominess of the outlook on our
arrival at Barrig&oacute;n was the thought that we should be obliged to
leave our launch&mdash;where we were so comfortable&mdash;for the
dismal, steaming pest-hole on the river&rsquo;s bank. We did not for a
moment think of asking for shelter in the filthy shack occupied by the
negro family. That would be tantamount to courting
<i>paludismo</i>&mdash;malarial fever&mdash;in its worst form.
Fortunately, we had a good tent with us, and in this we could be
shielded from sun and rain, and, at the same time, escape some of the
unsanitary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>features that rendered this spot so forbidding
and dangerous. It was really the first place that we had yet visited
from which we instinctively shrank and from which we wished to depart
at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>While thus preoccupied and devising ways and means for rendering our
enforced detention at this spot as endurable as circumstances would
permit, our captain, God bless him! observing our distress, came to us,
and with a kindness and courtesy we can never forget, said,
&ldquo;<i lang="es">No se <span class="corr" id="xd21e4579" title=
"Source: precupen">preocupen</span>, Se&ntilde;ores, la lancha
quedar&aacute; aqu&iacute; hasta que vengan las bestias.</i>&rdquo; Do
not worry, gentlemen, the launch will remain here until the arrival of
your animals.</p>
<p>What a relief this kind and considerate act was&mdash;performed when
and where it counted for so much to us&mdash;only those can realize who
have been placed in similar situations. Everything was now as well
provided for as might be, except food. Where that was to come from was
a mystery, as we did not wish to draw on the very limited supply we had
brought with us.</p>
<p>Our first meal consisted of pl&aacute;tanos&mdash;some boiled and
some fried&mdash;with a cup of black coffee. I had never eaten a dozen
bananas in any form before coming to South America, but I gradually
became accustomed to them, although I never relished them. Here,
however, there was nothing else in sight, except two or three ducks
that were quacking about the green, miasmatic pools that surrounded the
negro shanty. We endeavored to purchase these, but, although we offered
the old dame several times what they were worth, she would not part
with them. No African ever held on more tenaciously to his fetish or
rabbit-foot than did this swart Ethiopian hag of Puerto Nuevo to her
prized webfeet.</p>
<p>For our dinner we fared better. Fortunately and quite unexpectedly,
someone succeeded in landing a large and delicious fish, which was
quite sufficient to furnish a meal for ourselves and crew. A new source
of food-supply was now indicated, but try as we would, it was
impossible to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>catch another fish&mdash;large or small. The
impetuous current of the muddy river was decidedly adverse to our
rising piscatorial hopes. But we determined not to worry on account of
our lack of success as anglers. &ldquo;Sufficient for the day is the
evil thereof.&rdquo; Providence, we were sure, would provide for the
morrow. Probably our men and mules would arrive. If not, the mail
carriers would undoubtedly come, and then no <i>Deus ex machina</i>
would be necessary to extricate us from our embarrassing situation.</p>
<p>A dreary day passed and a more dreary night. What with the suspense
and the lack of proper food, and the confinement to a disagreeable spot
in the impenetrable forest, our position was such as not to encourage
slumber by night or rapturous admiration of tropical flora during the
day. Nevertheless, we still instinctively felt that relief would not be
long in coming.</p>
<p>The second morning we had our usual desayuno of black coffee and
pl&aacute;tanos. And to our amazement, there was added to this simple
fare a fine roast chicken. Where did it come from? We had seen no
chickens anywhere about the premises, and could not have been more
surprised if it had dropped from the blue sky. I asked the captain, and
he quietly replied with a smile, &ldquo;<i>Un poco de diplomacia. Nada
mas.</i>&rdquo; A little diplomacy. Nothing more. Ever considerate
about our comfort and needs, he had instituted a search for provisions,
and learned that the <i>la vieja</i>&mdash;the old woman, as he called
her&mdash;had some chickens concealed not far from the house, and,
whether by persuasion or threats, he would not say, he induced her to
part with one of them, and intimated that the same diplomacy he had
employed in getting the first, would, if necessary, avail in securing
others. The outlook was still brightening, and we now felt more than
ever that our deliverance was near.</p>
<p>Shortly after midday, while we were taking our usual siesta in the
launch, we were suddenly startled by an unearthly noise. All the dogs
and whelps of the place and all the &ldquo;curs of low
degree&rdquo;&mdash;and there were many of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>them&mdash;began to bark at once. And then in
the forest near by there was such shouting and screaming on the part of
men and boys, accompanied by the neighing of horses and the braying of
mules, that it seemed that a troop of guerrillas was bearing down upon
us. Never before had we heard anything like it, except possibly a Sioux
or Navajo war whoop. They seemed to desire to frighten us to death
before attacking us <i>vi et armis</i>. But no music could have been
more grateful to our ears than were those discordant notes emitted by
man and beast. We knew at once what it all meant, and, almost before we
could reach the top of the bank, our animals and men were all gathered
in the small free space in front of the cabin, and with them were the
bearers of the Bogot&aacute; mail. There were about thirty mules and
horses, and more than a dozen men.</p>
<p>We had telegraphed for mules only, as we did not think we should be
able to get horses, but to our delight we found that we were to have
two good saddle horses for our personal use, besides the mules destined
for our baggage. As, however, both men and animals needed rest, after
their long tiresome trip from Villavicencio, it was deemed best to
defer our departure until the following morning. The animals were then
turned loose to browse on whatever they could find to appease hunger,
and their masters were soon ensconced in their hammocks, slung wherever
they could find a suitable place for them.</p>
<p>It was arranged with our vaqueano that we should all be ready for
our journey across the llanos <i>de madrugada</i>&mdash;at early
dawn&mdash;the following morning. We had a long day&rsquo;s ride before
us, as the nearest stopping place, where we could hope to find food and
shelter, was at a place called Barrancas, where was the house of the
owner of a large <i>hato</i>&mdash;cattle farm.</p>
<p>Bright and early, then, the next morning, our peons and vaqueano
were busy saddling our horses and packing our baggage on the backs of
the mules. The mail bongo from Orocu&eacute;&mdash;which had left that
place ten days before we did<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href=
"#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>&mdash;arrived a few hours before
our departure, and all mail matter was hurriedly put on the backs of
other mules by those in charge of the mail destined for Bogot&aacute;
and intervening points.</p>
<p>It was not without a pang that we bade farewell to our devoted crew,
who had done so much to render our voyage on the Meta and Humea as
pleasant as it was memorable. From the ever-courteous and thoughtful
captain to our good-natured and obliging Guahibo, we were always the
recipients of delicate attentions of every kind. We might travel far
before again meeting with men so kind and so sympathetic as were those
four whom it was our good fortune to meet in an isolated village of
far-off Colombia. &ldquo;God bless you all!&rdquo; we said in parting.
&ldquo;Nothing is too good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the first hour after starting we had to struggle through what
the natives call the <i>monta&ntilde;a</i>. It had nothing mountainous
about it, as the name would seem to indicate, but was a dark, nearly
impervious wood almost on a level with the waters of the Humea. In the
dry season, I doubt not, the path through this forest would present no
difficulty, but during the rainy season it was next to impassable.
Everywhere there was deep, sticky mud and deeper pools and dirty
stagnant water. Often our horses sank to the saddle-girths in the
tenacious slime, and it was only by the greatest effort that they were
able to extricate themselves. At times, where the mud and water were
unusually deep, we were forced, for short stretches, to make our way
through the pathless forest. Then every step was impeded by branches
and lianas and progress was next to impossible. Finally, with great
difficulty for the animals and not a little danger to ourselves, we
succeeded in effecting our exit from this terrible monta&ntilde;a, and,
before we were aware of it, we found ourselves on high and dry ground
on the edge of a beautiful, smiling prairie of apparently limitless
extent.</p>
<p>What a relief it was to get once more into the
open&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>into the broad llanos of Colombia&mdash;where we
could have an unimpeded view for miles in every direction. We had been
in the depths of the forest so long, getting only occasional glimpses
of the llanos on our way up the river, that we felt like a prisoner
given his liberty after a long term of confinement. Not that we had not
enjoyed the forests while we were in them. Far from it. We had enjoyed
every moment of the time spent in studying their richness and beauty.
But now that we had reached the llanos, to which we had so long looked
forward, and were no longer confined to the limited quarters of our
launch; now that we were on our willing steeds and could move as we
chose in any direction and as far afield as fancy might suggest, we
experienced a sense of freedom and agility that surprised ourselves. We
felt as if we had suddenly been transferred to another world, so
different was our new environment from that in which we had spent so
many weeks.</p>
<p>Never did the earth seem so green or the sky so blue, or the sun so
bright; never did the face of nature appear so ravishingly beautiful as
on that glorious May morning near the picturesque Humea. And away to
the west, partly veiled by haze and cloud, loomed up higher than ever
those vast mountains of majesty and mystery that seemed to overhang the
world. Yes, we were slowly but surely approaching the Andes, and in a
few days more, <i lang="la">Deo volente</i>, we should be scaling its
dizzy heights and exulting in the splendid panoramas that would be
presented to our enchanted gaze.</p>
<p>The landscape before us was indeed beautiful, entrancing as a
vision, fair as the Happy Valley of Rasselas. Exulting in a new sense
of freedom, and stirred by many overmastering emotions, we could but
exclaim with Byron,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e1920">&ldquo;Beautiful!</p>
<p class="line">How beautiful is all this beautiful world!</p>
<p class="line">How glorious in its action and itself!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have called the part of the llanos we were then entering a
prairie, but it was far more beautiful than any of our plains known by
that name. It was more like the palm-besprent delta of the Nile than
the tame and almost treeless reaches of land which characterize so much
of our western prairies. Here and there were coppices of graceful
shrubs made melodious by feathered songsters whose notes were new to
us, but everywhere, at no greater distance from one another, were our
old friends that had accompanied us all the way from the mouth of the
Orinoco&mdash;the ever-attractive moriche palms.</p>
<p>We saw also several other species of palm that excited our interest,
but none more so than the strange corneto palm. Like various species of
the <i>Oenocarpus</i> and <i>Iriartea</i>, it is remarkable for its
adventitious or secondary roots, which, springing from the trunk in
large numbers, lift it above the ground, and give it the appearance of
a large column supported on a cone of smaller columns inclined to it
obliquely. These roots vary from a fraction of an inch to several
inches in diameter. They have at times a length of from six to ten feet
and embrace a space of ground from five to eight feet in diameter. They
are frequently covered by vines and parasites so as to form a natural
bower which is used as a retreat by wild animals. Even the Indians have
recourse to these fantastic arbors as a place of refuge during rain
storms.</p>
<p>Here, as in the land of the Aruacs, the moriche palm is not only a
thing of beauty, but, for the Indians, a source of comfort and joy.
This and other palms, notably a kind of date palm, and the
<i>Cumana</i>, which bears a fruit similar to the wild olive, supply
the Indians, during certain months of the year, with all the food they
consume. Speaking of the palm, Padre Rivero declares it to be
&ldquo;the earthly paradise of the Guahibos and Chiricoas. It is their
delight, their general larder, their all. It is the subject matter of

<p>Like the cocoa palm, &ldquo;By the Indian Sea, on the isles of

<p class="first">When contemplating the bountiful provisions of Nature
in favor of the inhabitants of the tropics, as evinced in various
species of food-producing palms, we are forcibly reminded of the
statement of Linn&aelig;us that the first home of our race was
somewhere in the tropics. &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; says this illustrious
botanist, &ldquo;dwells naturally within the tropics, and lives on food
furnished by the palm tree; he exists in other parts of the world and
subsists on flesh and cereals.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The llanos in places are quite level, and intersected by numerous
ca&ntilde;os and streams. Some of them are so large that they could
easily be converted into navigable canals for small craft. In other
places the plains are undulating and are ideal grazing lands during the
rainy season. There is always an abundance of water, even in the dryest
summer, and the numerous groves and clumps of trees suffice to furnish
shade at all times for the largest herds.</p>

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">A Traveler&rsquo;s Lodge in the
Llanos of Colombia.</span></p>
</div>
<p>We had not proceeded far when we met a large herd of cattle in care
of herdsmen quietly reposing beneath some umbrageous moriche palm or
singing some favorite Llanero <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>song. Contrary to what we
expected, the cattle were not so wild as those we had seen in Venezuela
and, although we passed within a few yards of them, they barely noticed
us. They were quite as tame as any one would find in the pasture lands
of an Illinois farm.</p>
<p>But what a fine breed of cattle they were and in what splendid
condition! They were as fat, sleek and large as any we had ever seen on
the plains of Texas or Nebraska, and would, I am sure, command as high
prices in the stockyards of Chicago.</p>
<p>We were deeply impressed with the future possibilities of the
Venezuelan grazing lands, but we are now convinced that even a greater
future awaits the llanos of Colombia when properly exploited. To extend
the Cucuta railway so as to place Casanare and Villavicencio in
connection with Lake Maracaibo would be a far less difficult and costly
undertaking than many other railroad enterprises in South America that
have been carried to a successful issue, and that, too, when the
traffic hoped for was far less than it would be in this instance. Such
an extension, which would not need to be more than two or three hundred
miles in length, would put the Colombian llanos in direct communication
with the chief ports of the United States and Europe. By using fast
steamers, freight could then be carried from the heart of the llanos to
Mobile or New York in a week. What an immense development of the cattle
industry this would at once effect is beyond calculation. It would be a
greater source of revenue to the Republic of Colombia than all its
mines combined.</p>
<p>At the first blush this project may appear Utopian to those who are
unfamiliar with the country or who have never given thought to the
feasibility of the enterprise. Colombia, to most people in the United
States, is little better known than the territory of the Congo. Even to
the Colombians themselves, the llanos&mdash;<i>la parte oriental</i>,
as they call it&mdash;is a <i>terra incognita</i>. Outside of the
Llaneros&mdash;cattle men&mdash;who have interests there, it is rarely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>visited by any one connected with the
administration of the government. To reach the llanos from
Bogot&aacute; means a long and tiresome journey across the eastern
Cordilleras, and few are willing to undertake such a trip out of
curiosity or for the purpose of informing themselves about the
resources of this distant and neglected part of their country.</p>
<p>And yet, far away as they may seem, the llanos are not half so
distant from the United States as England is, and, with the steamship
and railway facilities above indicated, they could be brought as near
to New York in time as is London at the present.</p>
<p>Probably a more economical way of reaching the llanos would be by
the Orinoco and the Meta. During the rainy season, as we have seen,
boats of light draft, but of considerable tonnage, can safely traverse
these rivers as far as Cabuyaro or Barrig&oacute;n. A few hundred tons
of dynamite judiciously applied would effect a wonderful change for the
better in the beds of the two rivers named, and would render navigation
quite safe for the whole, or at least a greater part of the year.</p>
<p>When we note the magnitude of the beef trade between Australia and
the Argentine and the different ports of Europe, we are amazed to
observe that so little has been attempted towards developing a similar
but a more profitable trade with regions that are comparatively at our
doors. If these fertile and favored lands, instead of belonging to a
country long known, and looked at askance by capitalists and business
men, were a new discovery, there would be as great a rush towards them
on the part of colonists as there has frequently been to those Indian
lands that have, from time to time, been opened to white settlers in
Oklahoma and elsewhere in the West.</p>
<p>Now that our people are beginning to realize that the cattle in the
United States are not increasing in proportion to the demands of its
rapidly-growing population, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>may be induced to turn their
eyes towards the vast plains of our two sister republics of Colombia
and Venezuela, where there is, all the year round, abundant pasturage
of the richest kind for millions of cattle. There are vast fortunes
awaiting those who are willing to venture into these long-neglected
fields.</p>
<p>According to the reports of our Bureau of Animal Industry, the
United States has been for some years past suffering from fever ticks
and other plagues an annual loss of more than sixty million dollars.
This fact, coupled with the increasing demand for beef, renders it
imperative to seek for an adequate supply elsewhere. The cheapest and
best place in which to secure this extra supply is, <i>me judice</i>,
in the marvelous llanos so near our own country, which should, in the
manner indicated above, be brought much nearer than they are at
present.</p>
<p>I know that people will hesitate about investing in countries whose
governments are as unstable as those of the two nations mentioned, and
where foreign investors have found so little encouragement and
sympathy. There is, however, reason to believe that the age of
revolutions is coming to an end, and that it will, in the near future,
be succeeded by the reign of law. Peace congresses, arbitration
agreements, the spread of education, and the construction of railroads
have produced splendid results in other parts of the world, where
progress had long been unsatisfactory, and who will say that we may not
hope to see the same beneficent results realized in Venezuela and
Colombia? If all else fail, it is quite certain that our government
will know how to safeguard the rights of those of its citizens who may
have interests in these countries about whose validity there can be no
question. Now that all are so desirous of seeing improved commercial
relations established between the United States and the various
countries of Latin America, it would seem to be a matter of prime
importance not any longer to ignore the golden opportunities that in
the regions bordering the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>Caribbean have so long eluded
American energy and enterprise.</p>
<p>It was about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when we arrived at
Barrancas. We found here a good-sized house with an open
shed&mdash;<i>enramada</i>&mdash;near by. This latter structure is used
as a shelter for farming implements, harness, saddles, etc., and as a
place where peons and herdsmen may swing their hammocks and sleep
during the night. The house, to our surprise, had a tile roof, the
first we had seen since leaving Ciudad Bolivar.</p>
<p>The proprietor of the <i>hato</i>, whose home and family were in
Bogot&aacute;, received us cordially and did everything in his power to
make us comfortable. He also gave us his own room, which had a board
floor, another novelty to us. We were soon provided with a frugal
repast, after which we were entertained by our host&rsquo;s experiences
on the llanos. He was one of eighteen children of the same mother. He
and his eleven brothers own a number of ranches and have many thousand
cattle in different parts of the republic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the last war,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the soldiers
appropriated a thousand of our steers.&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you put in a
claim to the government for damages?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;but it did no good. I never got a <i>centavo</i> and
never expect to. If I had been a foreigner, especially if I had been an
American, I should have received compensation for my loss. The
government always pays foreign claims when just, but the citizens of
the country must be satisfied with promises. It always promises to
reimburse us for any losses sustained during revolutions but the fact
is that we never get anything more substantial than
promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The labor problem was as serious with him as with a Kansas farmer
during harvest time. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Es muy dificil conseguir
brazos aqu&iacute;</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;it is very difficult to secure
laborers here&mdash;he told me in a tone of sadness. &ldquo;So many men
lost their lives during the last war, that the country is now suffering
for a lack of working men.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209"
href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>And yet, notwithstanding his losses and his troubles, our host was a
thoroughly loyal Colombian. He loved to talk about his country, its
marvelous resources, and the great future in store for it. He spent
most of the year in the capital, coming to Barrancas only for a few
weeks at a time, and that only when business demanded his personal
supervision.</p>
<p>I was curious to learn from him, a Llanero, and therefore an expert
horseman, the shortest possible time in which the trip could be made to
Bogot&aacute; from Barrig&oacute;n. Some books I had read stated that
the distance from the head of navigation on the Meta&mdash;and we had
reached that point&mdash;to Bogot&aacute; was only twenty miles, while
certain Venezuelans I had met had assured me that the trip could be
made in two days. His answer was conclusive. &ldquo;The shortest
possible time without a relay of horses,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is four
days. To attempt to cover the distance in less time would be fatal to
the horse. I never try to reach Bogot&aacute; from here in less than
four days, and even this means hard riding.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4767src" href="#xd21e4767" name="xd21e4767src">3</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;But what brings you up the Orinoco and the Meta at this
season of the year,&rdquo; he enquired. &ldquo;You are certainly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>the first Americans to come here&mdash;<i>rio
arriba</i>&mdash;up the river. Others may have come to the llanos from
the capital, but, if they did, I am not aware of it. And why did you
select the rainy season for your journey? Why did you not wait until
summer, when it is dry, and when the roads are in better
condition?&rdquo; We then explained to him that no boats ascended the
Meta during the summer season and that we were thus forced to come
during the winter. Strange as it may appear, this had never occurred to
him. And yet he was an intelligent man and well informed about his
country and presumably about the means of communication with the
countries adjacent.</p>
<p>The Colombian Llanero is a most interesting character. He is
absolutely unique among his countrymen. The only people with whom he
can be compared are the inhabitants of the Apure plains and the Gauchos
of the Argentine pampas. Like these he regards as &ldquo;fortunate the
man who has received from heaven the means of safeguarding life and
property&mdash;a good horse and a good lance.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e4785src" href="#xd21e4785" name="xd21e4785src">4</a> Having
these two essentials of defense and offense, he is happy and
independent.</p>
<p>This is readily understood from his manner of life, which is quite
akin to that of the Arabian nomad. The desert in which he lives and his
eternal struggle against a physical environment that is as savage as it
is grandiose; his occupation as a herdsman and his roving life in the
boundless plain, have given the Llanero a character that is as original
as it is interesting.</p>
<p>As a son of the desert, he is a lover of music and poetry, and will
spend an entire night or several consecutive nights dancing, playing
his rude guitar, scarcely larger than the hand that twangs it, or a
huge banjo, and singing verses either of his own composition, or those
of some other poet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>of the plains. For strange as it may
appear, poets abound in the llanos as scarcely anywhere else. They may
be unable to read or write but they are nevertheless able to produce
songs&mdash;<i>tonos</i> or <i lang="es">trovas llaneras</i>&mdash;that
are frequently marked by rare beauty and depth of feeling. Considering
their limitations, their faculty for versification is often really
remarkable, and it is not unusual to find among them a singer that will
improvise with as much facility as an Italian improvisatore.</p>
<p>The Llaneros have a poetry of their own which they never abandon.
They compose what they sing and sing what they compose. And, although
they cannot as yet point to one of their poets who has had the
advantages of education and culture, they can, nevertheless, point with
pride to many of their number who have produced metrical compositions
of marked excellence and power of expression. The pity is that so far
we have no anthology of these poets of the plains. There is certainly a
rich field here for research awaiting some lover of the fresh and the
novel in literature and it is to be hoped that some one may soon
explore a domain that is so promising in results.</p>
<p>Their favorite compositions are ballads or rhymed romances, called
<i>galerones</i>, which are sung as recitatives. They closely resemble
the popular rhymed romances of Spain, and refer generally to deeds of
prowess performed by their own heroes in their constant struggles with
the wild and unsubdued nature in which their life is cast. In these
<i>galerones</i> valor and not love is the protagonist. Love, in the
metrical compositions of the plains, is always a secondary
character.</p>
<p>Two stanzas from a poem entitled <i lang="es">En Los
Llanos</i>&mdash;On the Plains&mdash;will exhibit the character of
these poems, and show, at the same time, that the Llanero has a keen
eye for the beautiful and sublime in nature and that his heart is open
to the sweetest sentiment and the deepest piety and reverence.

<p class="first">For the Llanero a view of the beauty and grandeur of
his surroundings is a call to prayer, as is evinced by the following
lines:</p>

<p class="line">&ldquo;O que prodigios! que beldad! El hombre</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Before daylight next morning, the vaqueano knocked at
our door, announcing that it was time to rise, as we had another long
ride before us and must start early. Coffee was soon ready for us and
also a roast chicken. The latter, however, was prepared in such a way
that we did not relish it. Then it was, indeed, that we missed our
Indian cooks of the Meta. We asked for some milk for our coffee, but
although surrounded by large herds of cattle, there was not a drop of
milk in the house. When we expressed surprise at this, the cook
replied: &ldquo;We never milk the cows here. We leave the milk for the
calves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had often had a similar experience in the large ranches
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>of the trans-Missouri region and was not,
therefore, specially surprised at the answer. However, a little
persuasion induced one of the peons to secure us a calabash of milk,
although his task was not an easy one. The cows, unaccustomed to being
milked, refuse to stand still, and in this instance, the peon had to
tie one of them to a tree. Even then, he was obliged to call in the aid
of an assistant before he could get the milk we craved.</p>
<p>On the cattle farms of Venezuela, where the cows are quite wild, it
is necessary to throw a noose around the horns of the animal to be
milked, and for one of the dairymen to hold it secure by a long pole,
while another does the milking in the usual way. Our peon, fortunately,
was not obliged to resort to such a drastic, time-consuming method.</p>
<p>Although it had rained heavily the greater part of the night, there
was no indication that the downpour would soon cease. On the contrary,
it looked as if it were to continue raining all day. Fortunately, we
were provided with good waterproof ponchos, and were prepared for any
<i>aguacero</i>&mdash;heavy shower&mdash;that Jupiter Pluvius might
choose to send from the heavy, lowering clouds that, pall-like,
overcast the sky.</p>
<p>Before we left Orocu&eacute;, at the suggestion of the prefect of
the place, we had telegraphed to Villavicencio for a couple of
<i>bayetones</i>&mdash;a special kind of poncho&mdash;and these our
vaqueano had delivered to us at Barrig&oacute;n.</p>
<p>To the inhabitants, especially the Indians of South America, and
more particularly those living in the Cordilleras, the poncho is what a
mantle was to an Irishman in the days of the poet Spenser. &ldquo;When
it rayneth it is his pent howse; when it blowes it is his tent; when it
freezeth, it is his tabernacle. In sommer he can weare it loose, in
winter he can weare it close; at all times he can use it, never heavy,
never cumbersome.&rdquo; In a word, this &ldquo;weede is theyr howse,
theyr bedd, and theyr garment.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4887src" href="#xd21e4887" name="xd21e4887src">7</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poncho or bayeton,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4894src" href=
"#xd21e4894" name="xd21e4894src">8</a> usually made of wool, in fully
six feet square with a hole in the centre to admit the head. Our
bayetones&mdash;called &ldquo;nabby-tonys&rdquo; by C.&mdash;were
really double ponchos, made by sewing together two blankets, one red,
the other blue. When the weather is damp and cloudy, the blue side is
exposed, whereas it is the red that is kept outside when the sun is
shining. The wearers of this useful garment have learned by experience
that these two colors are differently acted upon by heat and light and
they accordingly adjust it so as to secure the maximum of comfort. The
<i>manta</i> is a lighter covering made of white linen and is sometimes
highly embroidered. It is used when the sun&rsquo;s rays are more
intense, because it reflects the solar rays better than the red woolen
garment. It is, however, rather an ornament than a necessity, and its
use is confined almost entirely to the better classes.</p>
<p>Provided with a poncho, a hammock and a many-pocketed
saddle&mdash;which are almost as indispensable as his horse&mdash;the
Llanero is always at home. The two former, he carries in a bundle
behind his saddle, where they are always ready for him at a
moment&rsquo;s notice. In camping out he slings his hammock in any
convenient place, and, if it be in the open, the poncho is, by means of
a rope, held over it in such wise that he can defy the most violent
storm of the tropics, and sleep as soundly and be as well protected
from the rain as if he were under his own roof-tree.</p>
<p>Our trail was one of the numerous cattle paths that intersect the
llanos in every direction. The one we followed was a narrow ditch
filled with from one to two feet of water. Our vaqueano, who was in the
lead, trotted along as if we were following a dry path, and we had to
keep up with him or be lost. It was then that we realized the
impossibility of traveling over these extensive plains without a guide,
especially on a cloudy day during the rainy season. As well might one
try to cross the ocean without a compass as attempt to make one&rsquo;s
way over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>llanos without a vaqueano. There was so many
ca&ntilde;os&mdash;those natural channels, like deep ditches,
connecting streams and rivers&mdash;and morasses to cross that were
quite impassable except in certain places known only to the Llaneros,
who are thoroughly familiar with the country, that a stranger traveling
alone would soon find progress quite impeded.</p>
<p>To attempt to reach one&rsquo;s destination by relying on the oral
directions of a Llanero would be quite hopeless. They would, probably,
be worded somewhat as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continue your course over the savanna&mdash;<i>arriba,
arriba</i>&mdash;up, up, until you reach that bunch of cattle you see
yonder. You see them, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; queries the Llanero. They
are some cows and young bullocks, lost in the distance. Not having an
Indian&rsquo;s keenness of vision you discern absolutely nothing, and
yet, unwilling to admit the fact, you declare that you distinguish them
perfectly. Your informant then vouchsafes further information which, if
you carefully heed and are able to follow, will without fail, conduct
you to your desired goal. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;go
to a clump of algarroba trees, but leave that aside and veer towards a
group of palms which you will see from there. When you reach the palm
group, coast along the foothills, across the Ca&ntilde;o del Cayman,
for that is the name of the ca&ntilde;o, until you come to the
Ca&ntilde;o del Tigre. Next, you come to a copse of bamboos, and then
after that to the Ca&ntilde;o de Chaparro Negro. Near it you will find
the Paso del Ca&ntilde;o. Cross it and you will come to a
<i>morichal</i> at your left, but leave it behind, and continue a
little to the right for half an hour, and you will see the place you
are looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years ago I had received similar directions from an old woman in the
mountains of Conamara, but there, all I had to do was to keep on the
road, and stop at the place I was seeking when I reached it. In the
llanos, where there are no roads, outside the hundreds of cattle paths
extending in every direction, it would be natural for the traveler,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>depending on directions like the above, promptly
to lose himself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had a good vaqueano, one who knew every cowpath and
ca&ntilde;o and clump of trees between Barrig&oacute;n and
Villavicencio, and we felt thoroughly at ease under his guidance. At
times, it is true, we found it somewhat difficult to keep up with him.
He seemed to have reserved the speediest animal for himself, or he knew
better how to keep up a sustained trot than we did. But, be that as it
may, we managed never to permit him to vanish from sight.</p>
<p>As we were riding over the plains we observed a large number of
vultures&mdash;Gallinazos&mdash;on a tree near our path. Hard by was
the carcass of an ox, that had just died, on which a single king
vulture&mdash;<i>Sarcoramphus Papa</i>&mdash;like the one we fancied
that preyed on the liver of Tityus&mdash;was making his morning repast.
The Gallinazos appear to stand in awe of the king vulture, and were
patiently waiting till he was satiated before making any attempt to
appease their own voracious appetites. The two species are never seen
to feed on the same carcass together. We saw several other such vulture
banquets on our way, but never did we see so many of these scavengers
congregated around the same carrion.</p>
<p>After six hours of hard riding, most of the time in a heavy rain, we
reached Los Pavitos. It consisted of a small bamboo hut and a number of
sheds. Here we dismounted for our midday meal, which consisted of a few
boiled eggs, and a cup of <i lang="fr">caf&eacute; <span class="corr"
id="xd21e4938" title="Source: &aacute;">&agrave;</span> la
llanera</i>&mdash;that is, coffee without milk or sweetening of any
kind&mdash;<i>sin dulce</i>&mdash;as the natives phrase it&mdash;and
some crackers that we had in an improvised haversack.</p>
<p>The family living in the hut consisted of three persons&mdash;man,
wife and their little daughter, a sweet child of about four years of
age. Both mother and child were neatly dressed, and had a genteel
appearance that was in marked contrast with their surroundings. The
child wore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>a tidy pink dress, tastefully ornamented, and
seemed as if she had just come from the class-room of a convent school.
The family impressed us as having seen better days, and had evidently
not lived always so far away from their fellows.</p>
<p>Near the house stood a large calabash tree, bearing the largest
fruit of the kind we had yet observed. Some of the specimens of this
tree looked not unlike green pumpkins, and were fully from ten to
twelve inches in diameter. It is well named the crockery tree, because,
in the tropics, it supplies to a great extent the kitchen utensils
which are elsewhere made from clay.</p>
<p>Within a few steps of the tree mentioned was a broad, murmuring
stream&mdash;shaded on both sides by large, overhanging trees&mdash;of
pure crystal water. It was the first time in many weeks that we had
seen clear, flowing water, and then was brought home to us, as never
before, the truth of old Captain John Hawkins&rsquo; expressive words
that there is nothing &ldquo;so toothsome as running water.&rdquo;
While on the Orinoco and the Meta, we always had with us large
earthenware filters, for it was not safe to drink the muddy waters of
these rivers, often containing more or less decaying animal matter.</p>
<p>The last thing we did before leaving our launch was to fill our
canteen with filtered water. But more than a day had elapsed since
then, and our supply was exhausted. We accordingly proceeded to
replenish our canteen with water from the neighboring stream, but, as
soon as the lady of the house saw what we were about, she begged us to
permit her to render us this little service. &ldquo;I know where the
water is best,&rdquo; said she, and, taking the canteen, she waded out
almost to the middle of the stream and in a few moments returned with a
new supply of water fresh from the Andes.</p>
<p>As we prepared to leave, mother and child&mdash;the father was sick
abed with malaria&mdash;both expressed their regret that we could not
remain longer. &ldquo;We feel greatly honored,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>the
good woman said, &ldquo;by your visit, and, if you ever come this way
again, you must be sure to come to Los Pavitos. <i lang="es">Dios
guarde &aacute; VV. y feliz viaje.</i>&rdquo; May God protect you and
may you have a happy journey.</p>
<p>Such were the parting words of this gentle soul in the wilderness,
words of tenderest charity and sweetest benediction. For hours
afterwards her touching accents seemed like music in our ears, and the
image of her lovely child, her darling <i>ni&ntilde;ita</i>, nestling
by her side, with her little hands waving us a fond adieu, was before
our eyes long after we had left the llanos far behind us.</p>
<p>What was it in these gentle creatures, whom we saw for only a few
moments, that appealed to us so strongly? Was it that secret bond of
sympathy&mdash;highly intensified by circumstances and
environment&mdash;that makes all the world akin? Was it the same
sentiment that touched the artistic soul of Raphael, when, on passing
through an Italian village, he saw the mother and child whom he has
immortalized in his <i lang="it">Madonna della Sedia</i>. Or were we
just then in the mood that impelled Goethe to indite his soul-subduing
ballad <i lang="de">Der Wanderer</i>? Perhaps. Let the reader judge
from the following stanza:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Farewell!</p>
<p class="line">O Nature, guide me on my way!</p>
<p class="line">The wandering stranger guide,</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="line">&ldquo;To a sheltering place,</p>
<p class="line">From north winds safe!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And when I come</p>
<p class="line">Home to my cot</p>
<p class="line">At evening,</p>
<p class="line">Illumined by the setting sun,</p>
<p class="line">Let me a woman see like this,</p>
<p class="line">Her infant in her arms!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">After leaving Los Pavitos, we still had a three-hours
ride ahead of us before reaching Las Palmas, where we <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>purposed stopping for the night. Fortunately, it
had ceased raining and our trail was now in a much better condition
than it had been since leaving Barrancas.</p>
<p>It contributed much to our comfort, too, that we were able to
complete our day&rsquo;s journey under sun-proof clouds. So far we had
not suffered the slightest inconvenience from the exaggerated heat of
the plains. Some of our Ciudad Bolivar friends had told us that the
heat of the llanos was so intense that it would be necessary, if we
would avoid sunstroke, to travel by night. As a matter of fact, the
temperature was never above 80&deg; F. During the greater part of the
time it was several degrees below this figure. Besides, to attempt to
cross the llanos in the rainy season, during the pitch-dark nights that
usually prevail, would be like trying to find one&rsquo;s way through a
Cimmerian bog. Not even the most experienced vaqueano would venture on
such a foolhardy journey.</p>
<p>We arrived at Las Palmas just as the rays of the setting sun were
beginning to throw a veil of crimson and purple over the distant
summits of the Cordilleras. Here we met with the same cordial reception
as elsewhere on the llanos. As, however, there was not room enough in
the small <i>choza</i> and <i>enramada</i> for our entire party, we had
recourse to our portable tent, which we always had with us for such
emergencies. When we enquired of our host what he could offer us for
<i>comida</i>, he sadly replied he had nothing but bananas, which were
at our disposition. There were no eggs or chickens, and, although there
were herds of cattle all around us, it was quite impossible to get a
draught of milk. The cows would not permit anyone to milk them.</p>
<p>We then remembered that we yet had in our haversack a small tin box,
still unopened, of sliced Chicago bacon. This, with some crackers, was
all that was left of the little store of provisions that we had brought
with us. It was not without grave misgivings that we proceeded to open
this remnant of our food-supply. We had, on several former occasions,
found that our canned goods were unfit <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>for use, and what if
the contents of this last box should be spoiled? It meant that we
should be reduced to extremely short rations until we should reach
Villavicencio, and there was no certainty when that would be. We had
still another <i>monta&ntilde;a</i> to pass, many rivers and
ca&ntilde;os to cross, and, above all, the terrible Ocoa, which, on
account of the floods that had been overflowing its banks during the
past week, our vaqueano said, might delay us for several days.</p>
<p>But the good God, who takes care of the birds of the air and clothes
the lily of the field, had not forgotten us. We found the contents of
the box as fresh and wholesome as when first enclosed in the far-off
metropolis on Lake Michigan, and very pleasant was it, as the reader
can imagine, for us, who had so long fared on chicken, eggs and
bananas, to have a change in our aliment, in the form of sweet, nutty,
breakfast bacon and that, too, from the glorious land of the Stars and
Stripes.</p>
<p>Early the next morning we were again in the saddle. Before bidding
us adieu our kindly host expressed his regret that he was unable to
give us better entertainment. He wished us to understand that it was
through lack of means and not of good will. &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Dispense la mala posada</i>,&rdquo; excuse our poor lodging house,
he said&mdash;and his wife and daughter, a fair young girl just
entering her teens, re-echoed his apologies and in accents that left no
doubt as to their sincerity.</p>
<p>During the latter part of the night at Las Palmas, there was a
genuine tropical <i>aguacero</i>&mdash;the heaviest downpour that we
had yet witnessed. When we started from there the next morning it was
still raining heavily, and with no indication that there was to be a
change until late in the day, if then. Now, more than ever, we
congratulated ourselves on having secured our bayetones just when they
were so much needed. They were all they had been represented to be and
more. Although we had already spent many hours in continuous rainfalls,
not a drop of moisture had yet reached our persons, and we had remained
as dry as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>if we had traveled under a cloudless sky. The
raincoats we had brought with us, although guaranteed to be the best
waterproofs made, would never have served the purpose that our
bayetones answered so admirably.</p>

<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Our Camp in the

</div>
<p>After about an hour&rsquo;s ride, we entered a monta&ntilde;a
similar to the one near Barrig&oacute;n, but greater in extent. The mud
was not so deep, but there were more ca&ntilde;os and streams to cross.
Some of them were quite deep, and in a few instances, the current was
so strong that our horses had difficulty in keeping themselves on their
feet. Several times we turned to our vaqueano to enquire if a
particularly large stream was the much-dreaded Ocoa. &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">No, Se&ntilde;ores</i>,&rdquo; he always replied; &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">El Ocoa es m&aacute;s grande</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the Ocoa is
larger.</p>
<p>We noticed that he was quite pensive and apparently as much
preoccupied about the Ocoa as we were ourselves. He then informed us
that he had learned at Las Palmas that the Ocoa had been impassable for
several days past, and he feared we should be detained there for some
time. Just then we came to the largest and widest torrent that we had
yet met. We effected the passage of this with the greatest difficulty,
and not without considerable risk to both mount and rider. After we had
safely gotten across I turned again to our guide and said: &ldquo;That
is surely the Ocoa, is it not?&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang="es">No,
Se&ntilde;or, el Ocoa es todavia m&aacute;s grande y m&aacute;s
bravo.</i>&rdquo; No, Sir, the Ocoa is still larger and more
turbulent.</p>
<p>Finally, after we had been about three hours in the monta&ntilde;a,
the rain continuing all the while without cessation; after we had
narrowly escaped being mired several times, or being carried away by
several of the impetuous water courses that obstructed our
path&mdash;there were by actual count more than thirty of them; after a
long struggle against the dread that was so greatly depressing our
vaqueano, and trying to take an optimistic view of our situation, we
had our attention directed to a loud roaring noise immediately in front
of us. We knew at once what that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>meant, and did not need the
information then volunteered by our guide, &ldquo;<i lang="es">He
aqu&iacute; el Ocoa, Se&ntilde;ores</i>.&rdquo; That is the Ocoa,
Sir.</p>
<p>A few minutes more and we were on its banks. Swollen to an unusual
height by the recent heavy rainfalls in the Andes, it was now a raging,
roaring mountain torrent that had attained the magnitude of a
tumultuous river which swept everything before it. It must have been
such a torrent that the poet Schiller had before his mind&rsquo;s eye
when he wrote <i>The Diver</i>, of which the following stanza is a
part:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And it seethes and roars, it welters and
boils,</p>
<p class="line">As when water is showered upon fire;</p>
<p class="line">And skyward the spray agonizingly toils</p>
<p class="line">And flood over flood sweeps higher and higher,</p>
<p class="line">Upheaving, downrolling, tumultuously,</p>
<p class="line">As though the abyss would bring forth a young
sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">C., who had never witnessed in Trinidad such
exhibitions of storm and flood, was in despair. Our peons, finding
their worst forebodings an actuality, were distressed and disconsolate.
If they could but reach the other side of the river, they would be
almost in sight of their homes from which they had been absent for more
than a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long shall we be obliged to wait before we can
cross?&rdquo; someone timorously inquired. &ldquo;If it does not rain
any more,&rdquo; the reply came, &ldquo;we may get over to-morrow
evening. If there is another <i>aguacero</i> in the mountains, <i>Dios
sabe</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;God knows&mdash;&ldquo;how long we may be
detained here.&rdquo; Just then, one of the peons who claimed superior
knowledge about the behavior of such <i>rios bravos</i> as the one
before us, gave it as his candid opinion, that, even if there were no
further rain, it would be quite impossible to effect a passage inside
of three days.</p>
<p>To one unfamiliar with the suddenness with which mountain streams
become raging torrents,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5107src" href=
"#xd21e5107" name="xd21e5107src">9</a> and the quickness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>with
which they subside, these declarations of opinion were depressing
enough. I had, however, spent many years among the Rocky and Sierra
Madre mountains, and had often had occasion to study the <i>modus
operandi</i> of the cloud-bursts that are there of so frequent
occurrence. Besides this, while our peons were disputing among
themselves as to what was best to be done in our embarrassing
situation, I had been carefully observing the height of the water line
and found, to my great delight, that it was gradually becoming lower.
After making a few measurements, I found that, if there were no further
rainfall, we should be able to cross to the other side before
sundown.</p>
<p>As it was now long past noon, and we had had nothing to eat since
early morning, it was suggested that we take a little luncheon, while
waiting for the river to become fordable. Suiting the action to the
word, a fire was started, our kit of kitchen utensils was drawn from
its sack, and in a short time we had a large cup of fragrant, black
coffee, and the remnant of our breakfast bacon fried in a manner to do
credit to a New York <i>chef</i>. We still had a few soda crackers, and
these, together with the coffee and bacon, furnished us with a repast
that left nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>Having no doubt about our ability to reach Villavicencio before
nightfall, we gave all the remaining eatables to our vaqueano and
peons. They thankfully partook of the coffee and crackers, but a mere
taste of the bacon quite satisfied them. They had evidently never eaten
any before and, far from relishing it, found it positively distasteful.
They had yet to acquire a taste for bacon as others acquire a taste for
snails and frogs&rsquo; legs. They still had with them a few
platanos&mdash;their staff of life&mdash;which they roasted, and with
these and the crackers and coffee we gave them they fared even better
than usual.</p>
<p>After luncheon was finished, it was found that the river had fallen
enough to justify an attempt to cross it. Great caution, however, was
necessary to prevent any possible mishap. First, the largest and
strongest mule in the drove <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>was relieved of his burden and
forced to cross the river alone. He examined it very suspiciously and
at first hesitated about entering the water. But he was so belabored
with sticks and clubs that the poor beast had no alternative. After he
had started towards the other side the peons all kept up such an
unearthly yell that he was afraid to venture back. After a terrific
struggle he succeeded in reaching the opposite bank.</p>
<p>The current was evidently still too strong to warrant another
experiment of this kind. So we waited about a half an hour, when a
second mule&mdash;a smaller one&mdash;was driven into the water. He had
barely reached the middle of the river when he was lifted off his feet,
and carried some distance down stream. It looked, for a few moments, as
if he was going to be lost, but, by vigorous exertion, he got on his
feet again, and stood in mid-river breasting the full force of the
current and looking piteously towards his masters for assistance. But
they merely jeered at him vociferously and asked him if he wished to
return to Barrig&oacute;n.</p>
<p>Seeing no help forthcoming, the terrified brute made a supreme
effort and succeeded in getting back to the bank from which he had
started. There he stood for a while panting heavily, after the
strenuous efforts he had made, but all the while looking wistfully at
his companion on the opposite bank of the Ocoa. After he was somewhat
rested, and before any one realized what he was about to do, the mule
was again in the water, making, of his own accord, a second attempt to
reach the other side of the river, where his companion was awaiting
him. After battling with the current for some minutes, he was
successful in his venture, for which he received the unstinted applause
of his masters. No sooner had he emerged from the water than he gave a
long, loud bray of victory which awoke the echoes in the woods for
miles around. The whole performance was so comical that it provoked
roars of laughter from our entire party. As an illustration of
mule-headedness in a good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href=
"#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>cause, in face of apparently
insuperable difficulties, it was superb.</p>
<p>Having proved the fordableness of the river by mules, the peons
determined to match their own strength against the still-impetuous
current. Accordingly, one of their number, a giant in strength, taking
the end of a hundred-foot lariat between his teeth, carefully entered
the water, and, after successfully buffeting the angry billows, landed
on the opposite bank, whence the two mules had watched his struggles
with apparent interest and sympathy.</p>
<p>Now that the lariat was firmly stretched between the two banks, and
that the river was still falling, it was a matter of only a short time
to transfer the remaining mules and the baggage to the other side.</p>
<p>The <i>jurungos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5141src" href=
"#xd21e5141" name="xd21e5141src">10</a>&mdash;a Llanero epithet for
strangers&mdash;were the last to cross. Elevating our feet as much as
possible, to avoid getting wet, we were soon in mid-stream. The motion
of the water in one direction while our horses were struggling in the
other, had a tendency to induce vertigo, but as we had to be on the
alert every instant, in order to preclude all danger of miscarriage, we
soon found ourselves happily landed, with the dread Ocoa at last in our
rear.</p>
<p>It was now only a short ride to Villavicencio, over comparatively
dry and slightly rising ground. Ere the sun had dropped behind the
Andes we had alighted before our lodging house near the plaza on the
main street of the town. Our host, who was awaiting us at the door,
gave us a most cordial greeting, but seemed to be much surprised and
embarrassed. He then explained that he had misunderstood the telegram
that he had received from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>Orocu&eacute; announcing our
arrival and requesting him to have
<i>piezas</i>&mdash;rooms&mdash;reserved for us. &ldquo;I inferred from
the telegram,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you were Colombians and
never, for an instant, dreamed that I should have the honor of
entertaining foreigners. Had I known whom I was to have as my guests, I
should have made more elaborate preparations for your reception. As it
is, I can offer you only an unfurnished room. It is the best I have,
and I trust you will excuse my not making better provisions for your
comfort during your sojourn in our midst. We have no hotels here, and
our people, when traveling, are accustomed to lodge with their friends,
or take an apartment like the one reserved for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good man&rsquo;s explanation was quite unnecessary, as we were
more than satisfied with our room. It was large and airy, and, although
devoid of furniture of every kind, it had a clean board floor, and that
was a great deal for travelers, who, like ourselves, had been roughing
it on the Meta and the llanos.</p>
<p>He was much relieved when he saw how easy it was to satisfy his
guests, and without more ado, he proceeded to order dinner for us
without delay. While dinner was preparing we had our dufflebags brought
into our apartment, and, in a very short time, our camp chairs were
unfolded and our cots and bedding arranged for the night. A table was
next brought in from an adjoining house, and soon a young Indian maid
arrived to make the necessary preparations for our evening repast. Our
meals, it had been arranged, were to be served from a restaurant a few
doors away. The se&ntilde;ora in charge, and her daughter, who belonged
to an old Colombian family, now in reduced circumstances, left nothing
undone to insure the most satisfactory service possible.</p>
<p>A bountiful dinner, such as we had not had since leaving
Orocu&eacute;, was soon on the table. There were meats, vegetables and
various kinds of fruits and, what we found specially agreeable, good
wheaten bread. Besides all these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>viands, there was an
additional and unexpected luxury in the form of a quart bottle of
generous old Bordeaux. It goes without saying that we showed due
appreciation of the se&ntilde;ora&rsquo;s culinary skill. Never did the
dishes of a Parisian restaurateur seem more inviting. Now came to us
with special force the old saying that &ldquo;appetite is the best
sauce,&rdquo; and that for travelers like ourselves, &ldquo;<i lang=
"fr">Il vaut mieux <span class="corr" id="xd21e5170" title=
"Source: decouvrir">d&eacute;couvrir</span> un nouveau plat qu&rsquo;
un nouveau plan&egrave;te</i>,&rdquo; it is better to discover a new
dish than a new planet.</p>
<p>As we had resolved to remain a few days in Villavicencio before
essaying the trip across the Cordilleras, we felt a sense of relief, by
anticipation, in the thought that we should not, before daybreak the
following morning, be obliged to hearken, as hitherto, to the usual
announcement of our vaqueano, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Vamonos,
Se&ntilde;ores</i>&mdash;Gentlemen, it is time to start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we were both quite fatigued, we did not delay long in seeking
repose on our ever-restful cots. And it was but a very short time
before at least one of the travelers was in the land of dreams. And one
of the visions that appeared to him was that of a little child in a
pink frock, standing beside her mother under a totuma tree, near a
crystal stream in the llanos, waving her tiny hand and lisping a sweet
<i lang="es">Adiosito</i> to two strangers from beyond the sea, whose
course was towards the western sky, where the giant Andes stood to
salute the approaching lord of day. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

surprising what erroneous notions have been and are still entertained
regarding the distance of Bogot&aacute; from the head of navigation on
the eastern side of the Andes. Many recent writers place the distance
at twenty miles. Michelena y Rojas, in his <i lang=
"es">Exploraci&oacute;n Oficial</i>, p. 293, makes it but four leagues.
Schomburgk, in an article in the <i>Journal of the Geographical
Society</i>, Vol. X, p. 278, assures us that by way of the Meta there
is uninterrupted navigation to within eight miles of Sante Fe de
Bogot&aacute;! The fact is that the nearest point to Bogot&aacute; to
which vessels of even light draught may ascend by the Meta is
Barrig&oacute;n, more than one hundred and fifty miles from
Colombia&rsquo;s capital. Small flat boats and canoes may, through some
of the affluents of the Meta, approach considerably nearer. During the
rainy season they may even reach the foothills of the Andes at the base
of which Villavicencio stands. But from here, the nearest point to the
capital which even the smallest craft can reach to Bogot&aacute;, the
distance is still ninety-three miles at the lowest estimate. To
navigate the Rio Negro, as Rojas and others imagine can be done, from
the llanos to Caquesa&mdash;thirty-seven hundred feet higher than the
plains&mdash;would be no more possible than it would be to row or sail
up an Alpine torrent. From Caquesa to Bogot&aacute; is not four
leagues, as Michelena estimates, but full twenty-five
miles.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e4767src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="first">Villavicencio, the capital of the National Territory
of the Meta, is situated at the very foot of the Andes, and is an
attractive town of about three thousand inhabitants, many of whom are
Indians. Its altitude above sea level, according to our barometer, is
slightly less than fifteen hundred feet. It is a little more than
ninety-three miles from Bogot&aacute; and has an average annual
temperature of 83&deg; F. During our sojourn in the place the
thermometer never rose above 76&deg; F. in the shade, and it was
occasionally several degrees below this point. And, although little
more than seventy-five miles north of the equator, it was so cool at
night that we always used our blankets.</p>
<p>A handsome church is located on one side of the spacious green
plaza. Not far distant is a well-conducted convent school in charge of
nuns recently expatriated from France, in consequence of the laws
enacted against religious orders. The people are never tired sounding
the praises of these good sisters and telling the visitor of the
wonders <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>they have accomplished in behalf of their
children. Here, as elsewhere, &ldquo;The stone which the builders
rejected; the same shall become the head of the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villavicencio, like Cabuyaro, and other places in the llanos, is
eagerly looking forward to the day when it shall be connected by rail
with the national capital and the Meta. For nearly a century and a half
a commercial route connecting Bogot&aacute; with the Meta and the
Orinoco has been talked of but nothing has been done to make it a
reality.</p>
<p>In 1783 the archbishop of Sante Fe, Monsignor Cabellero y Gongora,
then viceroy of New Granada, caused a map to be made of the course of
the Meta and the Orinoco to the Atlantic, with a view of developing
commerce by that route, but the all-powerful opposition of Santa Marta
and Cartagena nullified his efforts. Several times since that date the
project has been resumed but each time it had to be abandoned in favor
of the Magdalena, owing to the pressure brought to bear on the
government by the merchants of Cartagena and Santa Marta. There is no
doubt that the route <i>via</i> the Meta and the Orinoco would, in some
respects, possess many advantages over that of the Magdalena, aside
from developing much country now practically neglected.</p>
<p>Unlike Venezuela, Colombia favors free navigation of her rivers by
all nations, and would welcome foreign craft on the Meta as she does on
the Magdalena. Venezuela, however, favors monopolies, and, claiming
absolute control of the Orinoco, has closed the Meta and the other
affluents of the Orinoco to all steamers except those belonging to the
one company which has a monopoly of the trade of the Orinoco and all
its tributaries. How detrimental such a monopoly is, not only to
Colombia but to Venezuela as well, can be seen at a glance. Some of the
greatest resources of both countries are left undeveloped and progress
in any direction is quite impossible.</p>
<p>This matter was taken up at the International Congress of Mexico in
1901, in connection with a plan to render navigation possible through
the interior of the continent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>of South America from the
Orinoco to the River Plate, but so far nothing has been
accomplished.</p>
<p>The greater part of the eastern portion of Colombia is still
isolated from the rest of the world, and will remain so until Venezuela
shall recognize the fatuity of its short-sighted policy, or until the
great commercial nations shall demand that the navigation of the
Orinoco and its tributaries, like that of the Amazon and its affluents,
be free to all vessels, no matter under what flag they may sail. And as
soon as commerce shall awaken to the fact that an immense field of
untold riches is closed to her activities in the forests and plains of
the Orinoco basin&mdash;and that must be ere long&mdash;a demand will
be made not only in the interests of South America but also in that of
the entire civilized world.</p>
<p>As an illustration of how Colombia has been made to suffer by the
arbitrary policy of Venezuela regarding waterways, of which both the
sister republics should be beneficiaries, a single instance will
suffice.</p>
<p>Shortly before our arrival in Villavicencio, a company was formed to
supply electricity to the city. As there are no roads between
Bogot&aacute; and Villavicencio, which would permit the transportation
of the necessary machinery, the only way available for the introduction
of such heavy freight was by the Orinoco and the Meta. It was
accordingly planned to have the dynamos and other requisites brought by
this route, but, when all was ready for shipment, the projectors of the
enterprise learned that the Venezuelan government&mdash;that is,
President Castro&mdash;would refuse to grant the necessary permission
for the transportation of the merchandise in question. The idea, then,
of lighting the city by electricity had to be abandoned, and the
capital of the Meta territory is, as a consequence, forced to remain
content with tallow candles and kerosene lamps.</p>
<p>The people of Villavicencio, as elsewhere in Colombia, we found to
be extremely courteous and hospitable. They were eager to hear about
America, and in turn were quite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231"
href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>willing to afford all
possible information about their own country, and especially about the
llanos and Llaneros. We soon became acquainted with all the leading
officials and business men, and recall with pleasure the many delicate
attentions they showed us while in their midst. We were invited to
visit their country estates and to examine some new
industries&mdash;yet in their infancy&mdash;which gave promise of a
bright future.</p>
<p>One of these was the rubber industry. Not content with the trees
that grow spontaneously in the forests in this part of the country, a
certain general&mdash;one of many we met here&mdash;conceived the idea
of cultivating the rubber tree and had, accordingly, during the
preceding year, set out no fewer than a half million small trees, and
had it in purpose to plant many times this number in the near future.
He said all that he had already planted were doing well, and he had no
doubt about the success of the enterprise. He was most sanguine about
the future of eastern Colombia, and expressed it as his belief that in
a few years Colombia would be as favorably known for her rubber as she
is now for her cacao, coffee and tobacco.</p>
<p>There is no reason why the scientific cultivation of the rubber tree
should not be attended with as good results in Colombia as have so
signalized its culture in Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula. In view of
the destructive system of treating the rubber trees in Brazil and other
parts of South America in collecting the latex, and the increasing
demand for rubber in our various rapidly expanding industries, it would
seem that the rubber plantations, like the one above mentioned, are
sure to yield their owners a handsome profit.</p>
<p>Nothing better illustrates what may be expected in this direction
than the experiment made a few decades ago in India with the cinchona
tree. Previously to the introduction of this tree into India, where
there are now many extensive plantations under cultivation, the sole
source of supply of Peruvian bark was from the tropical slopes of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>the Andes. Now, in consequence of the vigorous
competition with India, the cinchona industry in the Andean regions is
only a fraction of what it formerly was, and, unless something can be
done to arrest its rapid decline, it will soon have lost its importance
as an article of export from the Cordilleras.</p>
<p>We spent three days in Villavicencio and enjoyed every hour of the
stay among its kindly people. We had thus an opportunity of securing
much needed repose, and of preparing ourselves for our arduous trip
across the cloud-reaching Andes. We might have continued, without
interruption, our journey from the plains to Bogot&aacute;, but it
would have been highly imprudent to make the attempt. A sudden change
from the lowlands to Andean heights, and from the heat of the llanos to
the frigid blasts of the paramos, is something of which the native has
an instinctive dread. He accordingly makes his journey by slow stages,
so as to become acclimated on the way. In driving cattle from the
llanos to Bogot&aacute; several weeks are deemed necessary, as
otherwise many of them would expire on the road. They appear to be much
more affected than man by rapid changes of altitude and
temperature.</p>
<p>We had been warned time and again by well-meaning persons about the
risk we incurred by so soon attempting to cross the Cordilleras, after
spending so much time in the lowlands of the Orinoco and the Meta.
&ldquo;You should,&rdquo; we were told, &ldquo;spend several weeks on
the road, stopping a few days at each posada on the way. Only in this
wise can you become acclimated, and render your system proof against
the certain dangers of violent changes of temperature and altitude. As
you approach the summit of the Andes you will see the sides of the
trail strewn with the bleached bones of cattle and horses that have
succumbed to the cold and the rare atmosphere of this elevated region.
More than this, you will see hundreds of crosses by the wayside marking
the spots where over-venturesome travelers were
<i>emparamados</i>&mdash;frozen&mdash;by the arctic cold of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>paramos, and where they found their last resting
place. And so strong is the wind on the <i>cumbre</i>&mdash;the
summit&mdash;of the mountain range that people are sometimes blown into
the yawning chasm that adjoins the dreadful pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To confirm their statements they reminded us of the fearful losses
in men and animals sustained by Bolivar when he led his army from the
plains of Varinas to the lofty plateau of Cundinamarca; how hundreds of
men and horses perished from the intense cold on the elevated pass
through which they vainly tried to force their way, and how the entire
army was exposed to extermination by the combined action of arctic cold
and hurricane blasts.</p>
<p>We made no reply to these well-meant warnings, but we could not help
recalling similar words of caution before we started on our journey up
the Orinoco and the Meta. Then the dangers to be apprehended were from
the climate&mdash;from intense heat and a pestiferous atmosphere; from
wild animals and wilder men. Now it was danger of an opposite
kind&mdash;danger from cold, of being frozen, or of contracting
pneumonia, which in those great altitudes is certain death.</p>
<p>Aside from a few uncomfortable nights&mdash;which, with a little
care, might have been obviated&mdash;caused by the active
<i>zancudo</i> and the <i>coloradito</i>&mdash;we had escaped all the
predicted dangers of the lowlands, and we now felt reasonably sure that
we should be equally fortunate in eluding those that were said to await
us in the regions of everlasting snow. We were better equipped for
making the trip than the poor, ill-clad natives from the llanos, and we
could regulate our vesture to suit the temperature. Snow and frost had
then no terrors for us, and as we had been accustomed to sudden changes
of altitude, without experiencing any evil effects, we felt we had
nothing whatever to apprehend.</p>
<p>On the third morning after our arrival in Villavicencio we were
ready to start for Bogot&aacute;, and expected to make the journey of
ninety-three miles in three days. We had <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>secured mules that
were used to mountain travel. Those that we had in crossing the llanos
would never have answered our purpose. Our vaqueano and peons were
<i lang="es">serranos</i>&mdash;mountaineers&mdash;thoroughly familiar
with the route we were to take. They all seemed to be good, reliable
young men, and we felt that the last stage of our journey, before
reaching Bogot&aacute;, would be quite as enjoyable as any that we had
already completed.</p>
<p>After many cordial expressions of good wishes on the part of the
crowd assembled to witness our departure, and repeated exclamations on
all sides of &ldquo;<i lang="es">Fel&iacute;z viaje!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a
happy journey&mdash;and &ldquo;<i lang="es">Dios les guarde &aacute;
VV!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;God protect you&mdash;we said our last adios to
all and turned toward the Andes. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Vamos con
Dios</i>,&rdquo; ejaculated our vaqueano. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Y con la
Virgen</i>,&rdquo; was the response of the peons and the
bystanders.</p>
<p>From the moment we left the door of our temporary lodging, our road
was up grade. As we passed along the street that terminates at the foot
of the mountain, it seemed that all the women and children of the place
were at the doors to get a last view of the
<i>jurungos</i>&mdash;foreigners&mdash;whose arrival from the eastern
sea by the great river had been commented on as a more than ordinary
event.</p>
<p>As soon as we had passed the last house of the city, there was a
sudden marked increase in the grade of our trail, and we then felt, for
the first time, that we were in sober earnest beginning the actual
ascent of the Andes. In two hours we had reached Buena Vista, a lovely
spot, eleven hundred and forty feet above Villavicencio.</p>
<p>We had frequently been told in Orocu&eacute; and elsewhere that we
should have a beautiful view of the llanos from Buena Vista, and that
we would do well to tarry there for a while to enjoy the panorama that
would be visible from this elevated spur of the mountain.</p>
<p>When a South American&mdash;especially one familiar with the
mountains&mdash;speaks in terms of praise of any particular bit of
scenery, one may be sure that he does not exaggerate. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>He
is so accustomed to splendid exhibitions of tropical beauty and
mountain grandeur that he passes unnoticed what we of the North should
describe as superb, magnificent, glorious. Such scenes are to him as
common as the gorgeousness of the setting sun and the sublimity of the
starlit heavens are to us and fail to move him for the same reason that
the splendors of sun and sky rarely affect us as they would if but
occasionally visible. They are everyday objects and the pleasure they
should afford palls accordingly.</p>
<p>We were not disappointed in our anticipations regarding the view
from Buena Vista. On the contrary, it far exceeded anything we had
imagined. The sky, with the exception of a few fleecy clouds flitting
athwart it, was clear and the sun was almost in the zenith. Far below
us, and extending away&mdash;north, east, south&mdash;towards the dim
and distant horizon, were the llanos, every feature of which was
brought out in bright relief by the brilliant noonday sun.</p>
<p>In the foreground was the monta&ntilde;a through which we had passed
just before reaching Villavicencio. Farther afield was a limitless sea
of verdure, interspersed with groups of trees, which offered their
grateful shade to the countless herds that reposed beneath their
wide-spreading branches. In every direction the green savannas were
intersected by ca&ntilde;os and rivers which looked like streams of
molten silver. It was, indeed, a panorama of surpassing beauty and
loveliness&mdash;of its kind unique in the wide world. It was the
boundless plain in eternal converse with the heavens above. It was the
abode of liberty, and the trysting-place of life&mdash;life palpitating
in the sunshine and beneath the emerald borders of the sliver-like
water courses that were all hastening with their tribute from the Andes
to the Meta, which, far off in the southeast, seemed like a line of
union between earth and sky.</p>
<p>We have nothing in our country that can bear comparison with the
matchless picture seen from Buena Vista. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>The view of the delta
of the Nile&mdash;just before harvest time, with its numberless canals
and water courses&mdash;from the summit of Cheops, contains some of the
elements of soft tropical beauty so conspicuous in the Buena Vista
landscape; but it lacks the variety, the sweep, the coloring, the
harmonious effects of light and shade, the immensity, and above all the
wondrous setting afforded the latter prospect by the Titanic
Cordilleras.</p>
<p>But the measureless expanse of grassy plain that lies before us is
but an insignificant fraction of the llanos. They extend from the
southern slopes of the Coast Range of Venezuela to the base of the
Parime uplands and the Rio Guaviare; from the Andes to the delta of the
Orinoco. They are thus almost conterminous with the Orinoco basin.
They, indeed, constitute one of the three immense districts into which
the whole of South America is divided. The other two are the Selvas of
Brazil and the Pampas of Argentina, separated from each other and from
the llanos of the north, by low transverse ridges running east and west
from the Atlantic to the Cordilleras.</p>
<p>To geologists these vast lowlands have a special interest, as they
were at one time the bed of an inland sea more extensive far than the
present Mediterranean. Even now, during the rainy season, certain parts
of this immense expanse are covered by fresh water lakes thousands of
square miles in extent. A subsidence of a few hundred feet would again
bring the whole of this illimitable territory down below sea level and
cause again the formation of the great tropical sea that existed in
prehistoric times.</p>
<p>To the student of history a special interest attaches to the llanos
of western Venezuela and eastern Colombia. It was across these plains
and swamps, under the most trying difficulties, that Bolivar led his
half-clad, half-famished army, during his memorable march across the
Cordilleras, before achieving the independence of New Granada in the
famous battle of Boyac&aacute;.</p>
<p>But great as was the feat accomplished by Bolivar in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>traversing the llanos, great as were the
difficulties he had to contend with, they pale into insignificance when
compared with the hardships and achievements of the early <i lang=
"es">descubridores</i>&mdash;explorers&mdash;of these then unknown
wilds. Bolivar and his men traveled through a country that had been
long settled, and were among friends and compatriots. The early
explorers and conquistadores were, on the contrary, in an unknown land,
among murderous, relentless savages armed with poisoned arrows. They
were in a region where it was often impossible to procure food, and
where several times starvation was imminent. For months at a time they
wandered through dark, tangled forests, cutting a road as they went,
lured on by the hope of fame and fortune. Then they had to feel their
way through deep and treacherous morasses, in which they had to
confront even greater dangers than in the obscure woodlands. But
notwithstanding dangers and difficulties of every kind, they kept
moving forward through woods and swamps, across rivers and mountains,
ever in pursuit of gold and precious stones, and of the fabulous riches
of the Meta and the treasure city of Manoa.</p>
<p>Among these famous <i lang="es">descubridores</i> was the German,
George Hohermuth, whom the Spaniards called Jorge de Spira. Starting
from Cor&oacute;, on the Caribbean, with three hundred and sixty-one
men and eighty horses, he directed his course southwards, where, he was
assured, were inexhaustible treasures of every kind. Crossing the
llanos of Venezuela and New Granada, he must have passed near the
present site of Buena Vista.</p>
<p>During our journey we certainly crossed his line of march, which in
this latitude was probably near the base of the Cordilleras. Spurred on
by an ever-receding <i>ignis fatuus</i>, he continued his march until
he reached the Japura, an affluent of the Amazon, and but a short
distance from the equator. During this frightful journey he crossed the
Arauca, the Apure, the Meta, the Guaviare and other broad and deep
rivers. Of the countless difficulties he encountered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>in
his long and painful march, no one who is unfamiliar with the character
of forest and plain in the tropics, particularly during the rainy
season, can have the faintest conception. They far transcend anything
experienced by Stanley, or Mungo Park, or any other African explorer.
After more than three years of unheard-of sufferings, he finally
returned to Cor&oacute; with but a small fraction of the brave men that
had originally formed part of his expedition.</p>
<p>Hohermuth was followed by Philip von Hutten, in 1541, on a similar
expedition, who traveled over almost the same ground as his
predecessor. He, too, must have passed near where Buena Vista now
stands. His undertaking was quite as fruitless as that of Hohermuth and
his losses were greater. He spent more than four years in the llanos
and Cordilleras and, before he could return to his starting point, he
died at the hands of an assassin.</p>
<p>More remarkable still, in some respects, was the expedition of
Nicholas Federmann, who, like Hohermuth and Von Hutten, was in the
service of the Welsers, concessionaires of a large German colony near
Lake Maracaibo. Crossing the llanos, and the numerous rivers that flow
through them, he eventually found himself on the banks of the Meta.
Thence he proceeded west and crossed the Cordilleras, not, however,
without numerous victims&mdash;both men and horses&mdash;from the
intense cold on the mountain summits. He finally reached the fertile
plain of Bogot&aacute;, where occurred that famous and unexpected
meeting of Belalcazar, who had come with another expedition from Quito,
and Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada who, a short time previously, had
arrived with a third expedition from Santa Marta.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know what was Federmann&rsquo;s itinerary
after leaving the banks of the Meta, and the exact spot where he
crossed the Cordilleras. This we can only conjecture, as there is no
record of it, but we loved to think, while crossing the Andes on our
way to Bogot&aacute;, that we were still following the conquistadores,
and that ours was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"
name="pb239">239</a>]</span>the same route that had been taken by
Federmann and his brave men more than three and a half centuries
before.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5353src" href="#xd21e5353" name=
"xd21e5353src">1</a></p>
<p>After leaving Buena Vista, we were exposed to a heavy tropical
downpour that lasted the greater part of the day. Fortunately the rain
did not affect us in the slightest. Our bayetones and waterproof boots
kept us perfectly dry and, as the rain was not chilly, we rather
enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>Our path during the greater part of the day lay through forests and
along rivers and over mountain torrents. At times it was high up on the
mountain side, thousands of feet above the water courses surging and
foaming at its base. Again it was along the edge of a dizzy precipice,
where a single false step of our mule would have meant instant death to
its rider.</p>
<p>What gave us grave concern at first was the fact that our mules
always persisted in keeping on the side of the track next to the
ravine, no matter how deep or threatening it might be. We tried, until
we were exhausted, to keep them on the opposite side of the trail, but
it was useless. They seemed bent on courting danger, and on seeing how
near <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>they could keep to the verge of the chasm
without plunging into its abysmal depths.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for our peace of mind, we did not then know the Andean
mule as well as we do now. Had we understood him as well at the
beginning of our journey as we did at the end, we should have given him
a free rein, and thereby spared ourselves many nerve-racking moments
and many futile efforts to correct his persistent aberrations. Why a
mule prefers to walk on the brink of a precipice, whenever it has an
opportunity of doing so, rather than keep to what we humans should
consider the safer side of the path, is a mystery I do not profess to
fathom. I simply state the fact. I leave its explanation to experts in
mule psychology.</p>
<p>The country through which we passed was fairly well populated, and
we were never long out of sight of a habitation of some kind. Sometimes
the dwellings were of stone, but more frequently they were of bamboo
daubed with clay and thatched with palm leaf. The people, usually
Indians or half-breeds, were in humble circumstances but we never saw
any evidences of actual want or suffering. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Nunca se
muere de hambre aqui</i>&rdquo;&mdash;No one ever dies of hunger
here&mdash;an Indian woman once informed us, when we made inquiry about
the subject. If one should happen to have nothing to eat, his friends
and neighbors supply him with food. They are ever willing to assist one
another, and we were often surprised to see how ready they were to
share their limited store with others, whether in want or not.</p>

<p>A more friendly people we never met than the good people who dwell
on the eastern slopes of the Colombian Cordilleras. They always have a
kindly greeting for every one they meet. No one, not even the youngest
child, will pass you on the road without a cordial &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Buenos dias</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang="es">Buenas
tardes</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i lang="es">Buenas
noches</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Good day, Good evening, or Good night&mdash;as
the case may be. These cheering salutations, that were always
forthcoming, whether we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>met one or a score, young or old,
made us forget that we were in a foreign land, far from home and
friends, and quite reconciled us to any little discomforts we might
experience along our steep and rugged path. Here among these simple,
unspoiled people the brotherhood of man is not an empty rhetorical
phrase, or a vain poetical figment, but a living, every-day
reality.</p>
<p>How often during our journeyings in the savannas and highlands of
Colombia did we not recall the beautiful couplet of Castellanos
regarding the primitive inhabitants of New Granada!&mdash;</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Gente llana, fiel, modesta, clara,</p>
<p class="line">Leal, humilde, sana y obediente.&rdquo;<a class=

</div>
<p class="first">They are the same to-day, especially when removed from
the baleful influence of those who, instead of aiding them, would drag
them down to the lowest depths of degradation and servitude.</p>
<p>But obliging and honest as we always found these people to be, they,
nevertheless, invariably failed us in one particular. We could never,
except occasionally by accident, get from them a correct or
satisfactory answer about the distance from one place to another.</p>
<p>Never shall we forget our experience during our first day&rsquo;s
journey in the Cordilleras. Our objective point was San Miguel, where
we were told we should find a good lodging house&mdash;one of the best
on the road, we were assured&mdash;and, as the distance was great, it
was necessary to make extra good time in order to arrive there before
nightfall. The heavy, long-continued rains had made our trail extremely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>heavy, and in places almost impassable. The
hours passed and we found ourselves advancing much more slowly than was
desirable. The lowering clouds were massing on the mountain slopes, and
the rain began to fall in torrents. It then began to dawn upon us that
we might not be able to reach our destination in the limited time yet
remaining of the fast-departing day.</p>
<p>Further progress along our dangerous path in the impenetrable gloom,
that would immediately follow sunset, we knew to be impossible. We knew
or thought we knew, about how far we were still from San Miguel, but we
wished to be certain about the distance.</p>
<p>It was now about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and it was
imperative for us to reach our posada by six o&rsquo;clock, if we were
to arrive there at all that day. We accordingly inquired of one of the
many peons we met, who were returning to their homes from their
day&rsquo;s labor in the fields, how far it was to San Miguel.
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Tres leguas, Se&ntilde;ores</i>&rdquo;&mdash;three
leagues, Sirs&mdash;was the answer to our question.</p>
<p>This was disheartening. Our mules were now exhausted, and could not
possibly make three leagues in two hours over the terrific track we
were traveling. But there was nothing to do but push on. At the end of
an hour we asked the same question of another peon. &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Quatro leguas, Se&ntilde;ores</i>&rdquo;&mdash;four leagues, Sirs,
was the reply. This answer was confirmed by several other peons, whom
we also questioned. Matters were becoming serious, but we continued on
in silence, hoping against hope.</p>
<p>About a half hour later we again renewed our query. &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Una legua, Se&ntilde;ores</i>&rdquo;&mdash;one league,
Sirs&mdash;said a bright boy, who was driving a heavily-laden donkey.
It was now dusk, and as dusk in the tropics lasts but a few minutes, we
knew that we should soon be enveloped in total darkness.</p>
<p>A little further on, a woman, with a child in her arms, informed us
that San Miguel was &ldquo;<i>cerca</i>&rdquo;&mdash;near. This was too
ambiguous for us, as it might mean one league or several leagues.
Asking her how near it was, she replied <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span><i lang="es">muy
cerca</i>&mdash;very near. This was still unsatisfactory. She then
assured us that it was &ldquo;cerquita,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cerquitita&rdquo;&mdash;diminutives of cerca&mdash;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5493src" href="#xd21e5493" name="xd21e5493src">3</a>
meaning that the place was extremely near, only a few steps farther.
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Dando la vuelta de la
esquina</i>&rdquo;&mdash;around the corner there&mdash;she said,
&ldquo;is San Miguel, the second house you come to.&rdquo; Peering into
the darkness before us, we could barely discern what appeared a
projection from the mountain side. We had to be satisfied with this
answer as, try as we would, we could elicit nothing more definite from
our informant.</p>
<p>The darkness was now so dense that we were unable to see even as far
as our mules&rsquo; ears. There was then nothing to be done but to give
our animals the rein and trust them to carry us to our destination. As
if guided by a peculiar instinct, they carefully picked their way
through the mud, but we thought they should never get around that
corner towards which we had been directed.</p>
<p>We were now quite exhausted, as we had eaten nothing since morning,
and longed for a place of shelter, where we could find repose. Only
once before, in all my travels, did it seem to take so long to get
around a mountain spur. Years ago, in the mountains of the
Peloponnesus, I had a similar experience, but then the road was good
and the moon was shining. Here there was only a wretched, dangerous
trail, and it was pitch dark.</p>
<p>At the long last, we saw a light glimmering in a hut by the
roadside. This was something. The next house, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>was
said to be bard by, should be the long-desired San Miguel.</p>
<p>To reassure ourselves, we asked a woman who was standing at the door
of the cot, where was San Miguel. She did not know. She had never beard
of such a place. It might be at the other side of the mountain, or we
might already have passed it; she could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is there not a posada near here,&rdquo; I queried,
&ldquo;or a place where we can remain over night?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!
yes,&rdquo; the woman replied, &ldquo;there is a very good posada just
across the road&mdash;that large building right in front of you. You
are looking for la Se&ntilde;ora Filomena&rsquo;s house. That is what
we call it here.&rdquo; And so it was. A few rods away was San Miguel,
at last. Only the tired, famished traveler in a strange land can
realize how glad we were that the day&rsquo;s journey was finally at an
end.</p>
<p>We spent a very uncomfortable night at San Miguel, and were glad
when we found ourselves, early the following morning, again in the
saddle, bound for Caqueza, the capital of a district near the summit of
the Cordilleras. &ldquo;We must make better time than yesterday,&rdquo;
I said, on starting, to our vaqueano. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Si,
Se&ntilde;or</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;We shall arrive at Caqueza by four
o&rsquo;clock, shall we not?&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang="es">Es imposible,
Se&ntilde;or</i>. It is impossible, Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then, we
shall arrive by five, shall we not?&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang="es">No se
puede, Se&ntilde;or</i>. It cannot be done, Sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;At all
events, we must reach Caqueza before dark.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Tal vez, no</i>&mdash;Probably not,&rdquo; was his final reply,
and we had to let it go at that.</p>
<p>The scenery along our route between San Miguel and Caqueza was much
like that which we had so much admired during the preceding day. The
country was, however, much more thickly populated and we met many more
people on the way. There was always that same cordial greeting, that
had before touched us so deeply, and the same disposition to oblige us
in any way possible.</p>
<p>At one place on the roadside, we saw a young couple, neither more
than eighteen years of age, erecting a little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>bamboo cot. They were evidently just entering
upon house-keeping, and seemed to be very happy. The labor involved in
the construction of their future home was little and the expense was
nothing. All would be in readiness for occupancy in a day or two after
work begun. Then their little plot of ground, planted with maize, yuca,
plantains and bananas, together with a few domestic animals, would
supply them with all the food required and enable them to enjoy an
idyllic existence far away from the maddening crowd, and quite removed
from</p>

<p class="first">It was evidently some such Arcadian scene that was

<p class="first">Further on we met another young couple, radiant with
the glow of youth and present happiness, carrying all their household
<span class="corr" id="xd21e5596" title="Source: gods">goods</span>
with them. These were few and simple. The man carried a machete, and a
few rush mats; the woman a few simple culinary utensils consisting
mainly of a metal pot and a few calabash cups and dishes. They were
evidently looking for a site for a home, and probably, a few hours
later had, like the first couple we saw, their simple habitation well
under way.</p>
<p>Of these good people one can repeat what Peter Martyr <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>said
of the aborigines shortly after the discovery of America:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span lang="en-1600">A fewe thinges contente them, hauinge no

knowledge of thinges to come.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5608src" href="#xd21e5608" name="xd21e5608src">4</a></p>
<p>Later on in the day we came across more home-builders, but of quite
a different kind from those above mentioned. Toward noon, we noticed
some distance ahead of us, what appeared to be a greenish black ribbon,
extended along our path. It was about a foot wide and several hundred
feet long. We could not imagine what it could be until we were within a
few yards of it. It proved to be an army of ants on a foraging
expedition. There were millions, if not billions of them. Those on one
side were carrying pieces of leaves about the size of a sixpence. They
formed the green part of the ribbon that we had seen from a distance.
Those on the other side, moving in an opposite direction, constituted
the black part. They were all engaged in getting material for thatching
their curious dome-like homes, which are often of extraordinary
dimensions. Sometimes they are fully thirty or forty feet in
diameter.</p>
<p>We regretted that time did not permit us to examine the length of
their line of march, from their marvelous dwellings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>to
the trees they were stripping for roofing material. They have been
known to go a mile or more for material suited to their purpose and to
deprive scores of trees of all their leaves in a single day.</p>
<p>To one unfamiliar with the tropics, the depredations committed by
these destructive insects appear incredible. Of an unknown number of
species, they are among the greatest enemies of man in the equatorial
regions. They spare nothing. Gardens and orchards, coffee and sugar,
cassava and banana plantations disappear as quickly before them as
before blight or frost.</p>
<p>In the early part of the sixteenth century, according to
Herrera,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5622src" href="#xd21e5622" name=
"xd21e5622src">5</a> their numbers in Espa&ntilde;ola and Puerto Rico
were so great and their devastations so extensive and irresistible,
that they threatened to depopulate the islands. Various parts of South
America have also at different times suffered from the same
plague&mdash;rivaling the seven plagues of Egypt in the distress and
destruction which marked their path. Had we not had here, and elsewhere
in the tropics, ocular evidence of their prodigious numbers, and been
witnesses of the magnitude of the works due to their united efforts, we
should have classed the accounts left us by the early chroniclers of
the extent of the ravages of the ant plague among works of fiction
rather than records of authentic history.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5627src" href="#xd21e5627" name="xd21e5627src">6</a></p>
<p>The scenery along the mountain ascent was an ever-changing panorama
of rarest beauty and sublimity, such as no pen could describe or brush
portray. It exhibited all the tropical luxuriance of the llanos
together with the wild picturesqueness characteristic of Alpine
heights.</p>
<p>At times we wended our way along the banks of a noiseless river,
which, in solitary grandeur, was sweeping through verdant meads and
beneath arcades of sylvan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>green, carrying its vivifying
waves to the broad, expectant plains below. The placid scene, dotted
with human habitations, and variegated by bright pastures, the home of
contented flocks and herds, offered to the enchanted gaze, in a single
picture, all the fabled beauties of the glens of Tempe and the dales of
Arcady.</p>
<p>As we mounted higher up on our way, our route was along the verge of
deep, headlong torrents mantled in the shade of overhanging bamboos, or
obscured by the jutting crags and huge beetling rocks of the earthquake
rift mountain. Ever and anon, our ears caught the muffled but incessant
roar of thunderous waterfalls, which plunged from dizzy precipices high
above our heads, both to the right and to the left of our upward
path.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the deafening notes of these tumultuous floods, which
awakened a thousand echoes in the sombre caves and yawning gulfs of the
countless windings and abrupt breaks of the mountain ravines, died
away, before we found ourselves in presence of some murmuring cascade
that might well have adorned the grove around the grotto of Calypso. In
the gleaming crystal basin at its foot, embowered in vernal bloom and
eternal verdure, which diffused an aromatic breath over the passer-by,
was tremulously reflected the plumed crown of the palm tree under which
the weary traveler sought a moment&rsquo;s rest for his weary frame. At
every turn in our steep and devious path, our eyes were delighted by
some wild, struggling brook, that fretted its way through a
labyrinthine gorge, pranked with verdurous gloom, or charmed by some
wanton rivulet leaping over rocks or forming <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e5640" title="Source: limped">limpid</span> pools, canopied with
foliage and flowers of rarest fragrance and brightest hue, that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Forever gaze on their own drooping eyes,</p>
<p class="line">Reflected in the crystal calm.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is not an exaggeration to say, that in our journey
from the foot to the summit of the Andes, we passed in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>rapid review some of earth&rsquo;s grandest and
most entrancing prospects. Sometimes I was reminded of the mountains
and valleys of the Alps, at others of the peaks and ca&ntilde;ones of
the Rocky Mountains. Some cataracts recalled the waterfalls seen
leaping from the lofty precipices of Alaska; others, those that add
such a charm to the manifold wonders of the Yosemite and the
Yellowstone.</p>
<p>But the Andean views can always claim a superiority over all
northern scenes of a similar character, in the marvelous setting
afforded by the ever-verdant and exuberant vegetation of the tropics.
How often did we not wish, during this memorable trip, that we could
command the brush of a Turner or a Poussin or a Claude Lorrain, in
order to bring home with us copies of some of those wonderful pictures
that Nature exhibited to our admiring gaze in her great art gallery of
the Oriental Cordilleras!</p>
<p>The higher we ascended above the lowlands the less dense became the
forests and the less luxuriant the vegetation. At times there were
extended reaches of land that were quite treeless; at others the
surface of the soil was covered with scrubby growths that were in
marked contrast with the splendid sylvan exhibitions to which we had
been so long accustomed. But although the giants of the forest were no
longer visible, there was little diminution of the splendor of the
floral display along our path. In one place, particularly, we were
surprised beyond measure to find the whole side of a mountain spur
covered with a glorious mantle of immaculately white lilies. The scene
was not unlike one of the large lily fields of Bermuda, that supply our
Easter altars with their choicest decorations.</p>
<p>We were greatly delighted to find in the tropics representatives of
the feathered tribe that we were familiar with in the far North. Large
flocks of them annually leave North America and Europe to spend the
winter season in South America and as regularly return to their
northern homes the following summer. Some of them come from far-off
Alaska and extend their flight as far south as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>Tierra del Fuego. Others spend the summer in
southeast Siberia and then, on the approach of winter, migrate by way
of North America to South Brazil. Among the most numerous of these
marvelous birds of passage are certain species of sandpipers, plovers
and lapwings. The bobolink, known along the Chesapeake as the reedbird,
and dreaded as the ricebird in the rice fields of the South, extends
its migrations as far into South America as southeastern Brazil. Many
of our familiar warblers and sparrows are to be seen during the winter
months in Venezuela and Colombia, while certain cliff and barn swallows
penetrate as far south as Paraguay. On the Orinoco and the Meta, we
recognized many species of ducks that were familiar to us in the United
States, among which were the pin-tail, bald-pate, golden-eye and
blue-winged teal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plovers, sandpipers and kindred species,&rdquo; writes
Knowlton, &ldquo;take migratory journeys often of extraordinary length.
Thus the American golden plover, <i>Charadrius dominicus</i>, breeds in
arctic America, some venturing a thousand miles north of the Arctic
Circle, and migrates through the entire length of North and South
America to its winter home in Patagonia, and, curiously, its spring and
fall routes are different. After feasting on the crowberry in Labrador,
they seek the coast of Nova Scotia, where they strike out to sea,
taking a direct course for the easternmost islands of the West Indies,
and thence to the northeastern coast of South America. In spring not
one returns by this route, but in March they appear in Guatemala and
Texas. April finds their long lines trailing the prairies of the
Mississippi Valley; the first of May sees them crossing our northern
boundary, and by the first week in June they appear in their breeding
grounds in the frozen north. The little sanderling, just mentioned, is
almost cosmopolitan in distribution, breeding in the arctic and
sub-arctic regions and migrating in the New World to Chile and
Patagonia, a distance of eight thousand miles, and in the Old World
along the shore of Europe, Asia and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>Africa. The
Bartramian sandpiper, <i>Bartramia longicauda</i>, nests from eastern
North America to Nova Scotia and Alaska, and goes south in winter to
southern South America. The solitary sandpiper, <i>Totanus
solitarius</i>, breeds mainly to the north of the United States, and
winters as far south as Brazil and Peru. The buff-breasted sandpiper,
<i>Tryngites subruficollis</i>, rears its young in the Yukon district
of Alaska and from the interior of British Colombia to the Arctic
coast, and journeys in winter well into South America. The turnstone,
<i>Arenaria interpres</i>, a little shore bird, about the size of the
song thrush of Europe, is also cosmopolitan, breeding in high northern
latitudes and at other times of the year found along the coasts of
Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America to the Straits of
Magellan, Australia and the Atlantic and Pacific islands. It is one of
the species mentioned as making the wonderful flight from the islands
in Bering Sea to the Hawaiian Islands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5680src" href="#xd21e5680" name="xd21e5680src">7</a></p>
<p>By what miraculous instinct are they guided in these semi-annual
migrations across half the globe? Who bids them, asks Pope,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e1920">&ldquo;Columbus-like, explore</p>
<p class="line">Heavens not their own, and worlds unknown before?</p>
<p class="line">Who calls the council, states the certain day.</p>
<p class="line">Who forms the phalanx, and who points the

</div>
<p class="first">Have they a special &ldquo;sense of direction,&rdquo;
or is their &ldquo;homing&rdquo; faculty or power of orientation,
something that is tantamount to a sixth sense?</p>
<p>We now know far more about the migrations of birds than was known
only a few decades ago. We are able to locate many of them during the
various seasons of the year, and are quite certain that they never, as
an ingenious writer of the early seventeenth century maintained, spend
the winter in the moon, where they have no occasion for food; but we
have yet much to learn regarding the causes of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>their periodic migrations, and the nature of
that instinct that enables them to pass, with unerring precision, from
the arctic to the antarctic regions, and from the Old World to the New.
We are accumulating daily new facts regarding the distant flights of
the birds of passage, but, notwithstanding the many theories, some of
them more fantastic than scientific, that have been advanced to explain
the cause of the migrations of birds; why such migrations were
undertaken in the beginning, why they are still continued, and how
birds are able to find their way, during their marvelous flights from
the arctic to the antarctic&mdash;we are still in the dark about many
questions connected with those mysterious migrations, which have
excited the interest of even the most casual observer since the prophet
Jeremiah wrote: &ldquo;The stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed
time; and the turtle and the crane, and the swallows observe the time
of their coming.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5703src" href=
"#xd21e5703" name="xd21e5703src">8</a></p>
<p>Almost before we were aware of it, the sun had begun to paint the
crest of the Andes with bright vermeil and soft purple, and we were
still far from Caqueza&mdash;the goal of our day&rsquo;s journey. With
the exception of the half-hour we had tarried for luncheon at an
attractive posada, called Media Luna, we had been in the saddle all
day, and had pushed forwards as rapidly as the strength of our animals
would permit. We had left our vaqueano and peons in the rear early in
the day, and it was not at all likely that they would be able to reach
Caqueza before the following forenoon.</p>
<p>After a delightful, sunshiny day, the sky, towards sunset, suddenly
became overcast with dark, threatening clouds, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>and
presently it began to rain. One thing, however, was in our favor, and
that was the trail. It was in a far better condition than that of the
preceding day, but it lay along the breast of a precipitous mountain
slope, at the foot of which, within ear-shot, coursed an impetuous
mountain torrent. The greater part of the way was quite safe, and we
could trust our mules, even in the dark, to keep to the path. But here
and there were treacherous places&mdash;loose ground, and landslides
caused by recent rains&mdash;which rendered traveling, even in the
daytime, sufficiently difficult. In the darkness, that was every moment
becoming more dense, locomotion was positively dangerous. There was no
house on the way in which we could find shelter for the night. Our
tent, with our other baggage, was in the hands of our dilatory peons.
The only alternatives, then, were pressing on to Caqueza, despite
darkness and danger, or standing still in our trail, where there was
not even a shrub to temper the ever-increasing downpour. We elected to
trust our lives again to our mules, as we had done the previous night.
This seemed to be the lesser of the two evils that confronted us.</p>
<p>We then recalled the hesitating answer that our vaqueano had, in the
morning, given to our query about reaching Caqueza before <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e5717" title="Source: nightfull">nightfall</span>. His
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Tal vez, no</i>&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps not, was a
gentle prognostic that it was impossible, at least for the baggage
mules. As a matter of fact, they did not arrive until towards noon the
next day. Their mules had given out, and the vaqueano and peons had to
make shift to spend the night as best they could under an inclement
sky.</p>
<p>The last objects of interest that we descried in the deepening gloom
were a number of peasant cots perched high upon the mountain
sides&mdash;much like so many cottages in the higher Alps&mdash;and the
junction of two rivers&mdash;the Rio Blanco and the Rio Negro. The
rivers specially attracted our attention, as the color of the waters of
the one, the Blanco&mdash;white&mdash;was in such marked contrast with
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=
"pb254">254</a>]</span>waters of the other, the Negro or black river.
The one owed its color to the white clay soil through which it passed.
The other was rendered black&mdash;like the well-known bog-tinctured,
&ldquo;black waters&rdquo; of Ireland&mdash;by the presence of organic
material. Even long after the waters of the two tributaries had entered
their common channel, they kept quite separate&mdash;the black flowing
along one bank and the white along the bank opposite.</p>
<p>It would take too long to enumerate the many difficulties we
encountered, during our long ride in the darkness, before we finally
arrived at Caqueza. Suffice to say that it was several long hours after
nightfall, and that we were both quite exhausted, both by hunger and
fatigue. We never felt time to pass so slowly, as during the last hour
of the day&rsquo;s journey, when there was danger in every step forward
from the ever-threatening ravine, along the edge of which our path lay,
and we were quite ready to exclaim with Shelley,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;How like death-worms the wingless moments
crawl.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the posada where we purposed spending the night,
which was recommended as the best in town, we found sufficient to
appease the pangs of hunger, but we were soon made to realize that we
had another sleepless night before us. In San Miguel our quarters were
damp and our blankets wet, owing to some carelessness on the part of
our peons. In Caqueza the rooms assigned us&mdash;and particularly the
beds&mdash;could best be described by a single
word&mdash;insectiferous. They were a veritable insectarium that served
no scientific or economic purpose. It is but just, however, to record
that this was our first experience of the kind during our journey thus
far in the tropics. Under the circumstances, there was nothing left for
us to do except resignedly to exclaim with the pious
native&mdash;<i lang="es">Sea por Dios</i>&mdash;may it be received by
God in atonement for sin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href=

<p class="first">Our plan, on leaving Villavicencio, was to reach
Bogot&aacute; in three days. This we could easily have accomplished,
had there not been a mistake in the telegram ordering horses to be in
readiness for us on our arrival at Caqueza. The morning after arriving
there, when we inquired for our mounts, we were surprised to learn that
we were not expected until a day later, and that it would not be
possible for us to get animals until the following morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travelers usually take three days to make the trip from
Villavicencio to Caqueza,&rdquo; said Sr. N., who was to furnish the
horses, &ldquo;and I did not think you would attempt to make such an
arduous journey in two days. However, everything will be ready early
to-morrow morning. Besides a day&rsquo;s rest here, preparatory to
crossing the paramo, will do you no harm. Most people coming up from
the llanos consider it necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not desiring to remain longer in the insectarium, in which we had
spent so wretched a night, we removed to an
<i>asistencia</i>&mdash;boarding house&mdash;in another part of the
town. Here we found clean and comfortable quarters and had reason to
congratulate ourselves on our involuntary detention <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>in
this interesting town. We were both quite jaded from the long ride of
the previous day, and really needed some repose more than we at first
realized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did we not,&rdquo; it may be asked, &ldquo;continue
our journey through to Bogot&aacute; on our mules? Are they not the
best and surest-footed animals in the steep mountain trails?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply is best given in the words of our host at Villavicencio,
Sr. N.: &ldquo;It would never do for such distinguished travelers as
you are&mdash;<i lang="es">personas tan amables y tan
honorables</i>&mdash;to enter the national capital on such lowly
animals as mules. Only common people do this. Custom here makes it
<i lang="fr">de rigueur</i> for people of the better classes to travel
on horseback. More than this. Our people usually send word ahead to
have a carriage meet them in the suburbs of Bogot&aacute;, as they do
not care to enter the city even on horseback. Permit me to order a
carriage to meet you at Santa Cruz, some distance this side of the
capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thanked him for his kind offer, but replied that, while we should
be glad to defer to the custom of the country, by exchanging our mules
for horses, we should forego the usual formality of entering the city
in a carriage. We were simple, plain travelers and wished to remain
such till the end of our journey.</p>
<p>Caqueza, fully twenty-five miles from Bogot&aacute;, is the capital
of a district of the same name and, in location, is not unlike that of
many of the higher mountain towns of Colombia or Switzerland. It is
surrounded on all sides by beautiful mountain ridges and is about five
thousand and six hundred feet above sea level. The temperature at seven
o&rsquo;clock p. m., the day before our departure, was 72&deg; F., but
at no time during the day was it much higher. In temperature, elevation
and the beauty of the surrounding mountains it is much like Caracas,
and when the long-projected railroad from Bogot&aacute; to the llanos
shall have been completed, it will become a commercial centre of
considerable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>importance. The climate is salubrious and as
equable as that of Bermuda, and the town, counting about two thousand
inhabitants, is just such a place as the traveler from the lowlands
would delight to tarry in, if he were always master of his own
time.</p>
<p>Early the second morning after our arrival in Caqueza, we had bidden
adieu to this interesting town and its hospitable people and were on
our way to the crest of the Andes. Just outside of the town we crossed
the Rio Caqueza, over what looked like the Devil&rsquo;s Bridge in
ruins. Fortunately, we had grown quite accustomed to such shaky
structures, although, in the beginning, we approached them with the
greatest misgivings. Near San Miguel, for instance, we had to cross a
raging torrent, in a dark, deep ravine, over what was but the semblance
of a bridge, that threatened every moment to collapse. It was in
reality nothing more than three logs laid side by side and covered with
loose twigs and earth. It had no railings or balustrades at the sides,
and the abutments at the two ends had become so loosened by the heavy
rains that it seemed every moment on the verge of tottering into the
abyss below. Even our mules balked at the treacherous structure.
However, after taking a good look at the tumultuous Rio Negro, that was
coursing through the wild gorge beneath, and stretching their long ears
toward the opposite bank, as if to determine thereby what chance there
was of a successful passage, they finally ventured on the bridge, but
it was with fear and trembling. And how light was their step and how
they actually felt their way until they reached <i>terra firma</i>!
From that moment the much-abused mule rose high in our estimation. He
may be obstinate, but he instinctively avoids danger. And when he
concludes to go forward, you may be sure that the danger is more
apparent then real. Subsequent experience only confirmed us in the
impression that we then formed of him.</p>
<p>From the time we crossed the Rio Caqueza, our path was ever upward
towards cloudland. <i>La cumbre</i>&mdash;the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>summit&mdash;of the Andes, where we were to
cross it, is about midway between Caqueza and Bogot&aacute;, and is
nearly a mile higher than the makeshift of a bridge over the Rio
Caqueza.</p>
<p>We had left Caqueza only a few miles behind us when we found a large
number of market women&mdash;young and old&mdash;on the road. They were
mostly Indians, all carrying heavy burdens from seventy-five to a
hundred pounds, and, to our surprise, they were all <i>en route</i> to
Bogot&aacute;. I do not think we met one going to Caqueza. They were
loaded down with chickens, eggs, fruits and all kinds of garden produce
for the Bogot&aacute; market.</p>
<p>But think of carrying such burdens more than twenty miles, and that,
too, over the lofty Cordilleras! And think, too, of the slight pittance
that was often to reward the expenditure of such energy! Nevertheless,
all of these poor people seemed to be quite happy. They were constantly
chatting and singing, as they trudged along the rough, stony path, and
rarely stopped to rest. They were clad in a rough, dark-colored tunic,
something like the peplum or chiton of the ancient Greeks. Most of them
were barefooted, although we saw some who wore <i>alpargatas</i>, a
kind of sandal made from the fibres of the aloe, which flourishes
everywhere in the uplands of Colombia. As in Mexico, so also here, this
plant has from time immemorial furnished the natives many articles of
daily use.</p>
<p>What specially attracted our attention was the number of chickens
and eggs these humble folks carried with them to the market. When we
observed this and noted the number of cattle, horses and other domestic
animals we had seen along our route, and the variety of fruits and
vegetables that were under cultivation, we could not but recall what
Herrera has to say about the absence of these and other things in
pre-Colombian times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the other hemisphere&rdquo; (America), he writes,
&ldquo;there were no dogs, asses, sheep, goats, swine, cats, horses,
mules, camels, nor elephants. They had no <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>oranges, lemons,
pomegranates, figs, quinces, melons, vines, nor olives, nor sugar,
wheat nor rice. They knew not the use of iron, knew nothing of
firearms, printing or learning. Their navigation extended not beyond
their sight; their government and politics were barbarous. Their
mountains and vast woods were not habitable. An Indian of good natural
parts being asked what was the best they had got by the Spaniards,
answered: The hen&rsquo;s eggs, as being laid new every day; the hen
herself must be either boiled or roasted, and does not always prove
tender, while the egg is good every way. Then he added: The horse and
artificial light, because the first carries men with ease and bears his
burdens, and by means of the latter (the Indians having learned to make
wax and tallow candles and oil), <i>they lived some part of the
night</i>! and this he thought to be the most valuable acquisition from
the white people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5824src" href=
"#xd21e5824" name="xd21e5824src">1</a></p>
<p>At the time of the arrival of the Spaniards in South America, there
were no domestic animals except the llama, the alpaca, the guinea pig
and the alco, and these were found only within the limits of the empire
of the Incas.</p>
<p>There was a time, however, long anterior to the advent of
Europeans&mdash;during the Pleistocene epoch&mdash;when horses<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5833src" href="#xd21e5833" name="xd21e5833src">2</a>
and the larger members of the camel tribe roamed over the vast plains
of South America, notably in the parts now known as Argentina and
Southern Brazil. It was at this period, too, that flourished in the
same regions those gigantic creatures, now extinct, known as the
mylodon, the ground sloth, the glyptodont, the mastodon, the toxodont
and peculiar sabre-toothed tigers, vast quantities of whose remains
have been found and carefully stored away in our museums. Not far
toward the west of us, at the <i lang="es">Campo <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>de
los Gigantes</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e5843src" href="#xd21e5843"
name="xd21e5843src">3</a> in the Savanna of Bogot&aacute;&mdash;not to
speak of those found in the bluffs along the valley of the
Zulia&mdash;abundant fossil remains have been discovered of horses,
taxodonts, glyptodons, and megatheriums. It is, indeed, a remarkable
fact that the South American continent, which has enriched the Old
World with so many valuable medicinal and economic plants, has not
given to it a single useful animal.</p>
<p>After traveling some hours we reached Chipaque, an interesting
mountain town fully half a mile higher above sea level than Caqueza.
Our attention was attracted by an unusually large and beautiful stone
church, which was then undergoing repairs. A great bell, imported from
Europe, had just been put in one of the towers. It was the gift of Gen.
Reyes, then president of the republic, and the good people were not
only proud of their bell but were loud in their praises of the generous
donor.</p>
<p>But where did the money come from for the erection of such a noble
structure? The people all seemed very poor, and quite unable to keep
such an edifice in repair after its completion, not to speak of
supplying the means for building it. We frequently found ourselves
asking this same question in other parts of South America, when
contemplating the large and beautiful ecclesiastical structures that
are often met with where one should least expect to find them. The
builders of them evidently belonged to those ages of faith that have
bequeathed to us those marvels of architecture&mdash;the great
cathedrals of Europe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href=
"#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>Something that always afforded us great comfort, and that was rarely
far away, after we left Villavicencio, was the telegraph line. For
weeks we had been far away from it, and, in case of need, it could not
have been reached. It was then that we really felt that we were indeed
a long way off from home and friends. To communicate with them by
letter would then have required the best part of a year, for there was
no regular postal service to which we could have had recourse. With the
friendly and willing telegraph ever near, it was quite different. By
its means we could, in a few hours at most, convey a message to the
most distant parts of the world.</p>
<p>When leaving any given place in the morning our whole
party&mdash;peons with baggage, mules included&mdash;would be together.
But it was not long until we were far in advance of the vaqueano and
peons, whom we would not again see until evening or, as it sometimes
happened, until the following morning. There was rarely any danger of
losing our path, for the simple reason that there was, as a rule, only
a single path from one place to another. We had, therefore, nothing to
do but to keep to the trail. Occasionally, however, we would come to a
point where it was necessary to choose between two diverging trails.
Then it was that the telegraph line was an invaluable guide. We
followed the trail which it paralleled, and in so doing we never went
astray.</p>
<p>It was now several months since we had received a letter from home.
We had not even seen a newspaper of any kind, and were, consequently,
in utter ignorance of what was occurring in the great and busy world we
had left behind us. But strange as it may seem, the traveler in
Nature&rsquo;s wilds seems soon to grow indifferent to the
world&rsquo;s doings. Even those who at home consider the morning and
evening papers indispensable necessities, seem to forget that there are
such things. Nay, they even experience a sense of relief that they have
gotten beyond the reach of post and telegraph, and that, for once in
their lives, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262"
name="pb262">262</a>]</span>can call their time their own. Indeed, the
absence of the daily paper, with its countless dispatches, far from
being a privation, soon impressed us as a positive blessing.</p>
<p>We enjoyed a sense of freedom&mdash;the freedom of the child of the
forest&mdash;we had never known before. We were beginning to see how
easy it was to dispense with many things that are so often regarded as
essentials to pleasure and comfort. If we had been unavoidably detained
at some Indian encampment for a few months or found it necessary to
tarry a year or so in one of the little bamboo cottages on the eastern
slope of the Andes, we should not have regarded it as an unmixed evil.
Even as I pen these lines, I have a vivid recollection of a score of
tiny cots along the Rio Negro and the Rio Caqueza, near a purling brook
or a musical cascade, shaded by palms and surrounded by smiling citrus
trees, where it would be a delight to live and commune with Nature at
her best.</p>
<p>I can fully sympathize with Waterton&rsquo;s longing for the wild
and his love of tropical life. Every lover of nature, who has spent
some time in the heart of the equatorial forests, is affected in the
same way. The <i lang="de">wanderlust</i> and <i lang=
"de">abenteuergeist</i>&mdash;the love of travel and
adventure&mdash;grows on one, it seems, in the wilds of South America
more than elsewhere. Is it because the conquistadores and other early
explorers have impregnated the atmosphere with their spirit, or because
the environment of itself has the power of inoculating the visitor from
the north with the microbe of a life-long <i lang="de">wanderleben</i>?
<i>Dicant Paduani.</i></p>
<p>Recording his impressions of travel in Andean highlands a writer in
the early part of the last century says: &ldquo;A sense of extreme
loneliness and remoteness from the world seizes on his,&rdquo; the
traveler&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;and is heightened by the dead silence
that prevails; not a sound being heard but the scream of the condor,
and the monotonous murmur of the distant waterfalls.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5887src" href="#xd21e5887" name=
"xd21e5887src">4</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<p>This, undoubtedly, like many similar impressions, is a question of
temperament. As for ourselves we never, for a single moment,
experienced anything even approaching a feeling of loneliness or
remoteness from the world. Probably, like Scipio Africanus, we are
among those who never felt less alone than when alone. Far from feeling
lonely while crossing the Cordilleras, we congratulated ourselves that
we were far away from the beaten track of personally conducted
tourists.</p>
<p>We could not help comparing the splendid panoramas around us with
the noted show places of Switzerland. In the Andes it was the forest
primeval, or the humble cot, or the picturesque village of the
unspoiled and simple people of eastern Colombia, where a foreigner is
rarely seen, but where he is always sure of a cordial welcome. There
were here no tourist resorts, no palatial hotels or restaurants, no
sumptuous chalets or villas&mdash;seats of opulence and
luxury&mdash;but Nature alone in all her beauty and sublimity, as she
came forth from the hands of her Creator. We were far away from the
land of inclined railroads, leading to every peak, and from macadamized
thoroughfares, along which reckless drivers and wild chauffeurs are
constantly claiming the right of way, regardless of the safety or
convenience of the ordinary wayfarer.</p>
<p>The uplands of the Andes should be the last places in the world
where the thoughtful mind should experience a sense of loneliness, or
be oppressed with tedium or listlessness. There, if anywhere, such a
thing as ennui should be impossible. There is so much to excite the
imagination, and so much to gratify every sense, so much to exhilarate
the weary spirits and to elevate the mind, that one feels oneself in a
kind of mountain elysium, where every moment spent is one of unalloyed
delight.</p>
<p>Never shall we forget the morning preceding our first crossing of
the Cordilleras. The weather was ideal&mdash;neither hot nor
cold&mdash;and the scenery at every turn was magnificent beyond
compare. While the vegetation was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264"
href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>quite different in character
from that of the lowlands, it was, nevertheless, equally attractive and
fragrant. Our route at times lay through a narrow defile with wild
beetling steeps on both sides of us. Ever and anon we passed by natural
bowers, sculptured in the solid rock and entwined with odorous plants
and flowers, that might well serve as trysting places of fays and
elves, or be the favorite resorts of Titania and Oberon. Farther on our
way we descried a dark and romantic chasm which we could fancy might,
under a waning moon, be haunted &ldquo;by a woman waiting for her demon
lover.&rdquo; And higher up on a lofty peak, tinged with the roseate
hues of quivering sunlight, C.&rsquo;s fancy told us was the home of
that race of Oreads</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That haunt the hill-tops nearest the
sun.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Small wonder,&rdquo; said C, &ldquo;that the
lively fancy of the Indian should have peopled these romantic spots
with the creatures of his imagination, and that he should have woven
legends about objects and phenomena that had specially attracted his
notice. Even we, who see these things for the first time, find
ourselves under the spell of the <i>genius loci</i>. Considering the
beautiful arbors here formed by tree and vine and flower, the fantastic
shapes assumed by rock and mountain spur, the mysterious natural
phenomena that frequently obtrude themselves on his attention, and his
proneness to refer to supernatural agency everything that his untutored
mind is unable to explain, it would be a greater wonder if such legends
did not exist, and if the numerous physical features, that have so
often excited our interest, were left unpeopled by creatures of the
Indian&rsquo;s fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian of Colombia may know nothing of our elves and fairies;
sylphs, undines and salamanders; gnomes, kobolds and hobgoblins, but
his fertile imagination has, nevertheless, found similar beings to
people plain and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>forest and mountain peak. Now, as in the
days of their pre-Colombian ancestors, the Indian loves to regard
stones and rocks and trees of peculiar form or extraordinary size as
the abode of certain spirits, or as being in some way identified with
them. Like the Scandinavians of old, they see their deceased ancestors
in the dense clouds that veil the neighboring hill tops. And like the
peasant in the Hartz mountains, who has a superstitious dread of the
spectre of the Brocken, they quail before a similar apparition
frequently seen in the summits of the Cordilleras. They venerate the
rainbow, and see in volcanoes the abode of beings of power and
destruction.</p>
<p>To them, as to peoples of other parts of the world, the owl is a
bird of ill omen. One of them, called from its cry <i>ya acabo, ya
acabo</i>&mdash;it is finished, it is finished&mdash;is, when heard
fluttering around the house, regarded as a harbinger of death. Another,
the <i>pavita</i>, is considered as the spirit of some departed
relative who, like the Irish banshee, would warn his kindred against
death or some imminent calamity.</p>
<p>The Llaneros, fearless as they are in most respects, entertain the
greatest dread of <i>espantos</i>, ghosts or apparitions. The <i>bola
de fuego</i>, or the light of Aguirre, the Tyrant, is one of these
ghosts. It is in reality nothing more than a kind of <i>ignis
fatuus</i>, produced by the decomposition of organic matter, but to
their minds, ignorant of the true nature of such gaseous exhalations,
it is the soul of the infamous traitor, Lope de Aguirre, who, in
punishment for his atrocities, has been condemned to wander through the
broad forests and savannas that were the witnesses of his blood-stained
crimes.</p>
<p>In their <i>duendes</i>, if they have not the analogues of pucks and
brownies, they certainly possess a shrewd and knavish sprite, somewhat
like the English Robin Good-Fellow. Among the Llaneros he is noted for
the mischievous pranks he plays in the corrals, when occupied by horses
and cattle, and, if one is to credit the stories of those who live
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>on the plains, these particular <i>duendes</i>
give the owners of live stock a world of trouble.</p>
<p>The Serranos&mdash;mountaineers&mdash;have even more wonderful
stories to tell than the inhabitants of the llanos. The most remarkable
of them are connected with certain caves, which are so numerous in the
Eastern Andes, and certain lakes in which, the Serrano assures one, are
occasionally observed phenomena of an extraordinary character.</p>
<p>They are firmly convinced, for instance, of a certain witch or
malignant sorceress, called Mancarita, who carries away lonely
travelers, or those who may have lost their way in the mountains. And
they rehearse the tale of an Indian who concealed a bag of silver under
a certain water fall near a well-known lake. This is guarded by a
serpent or a dragon, but if one will, on St. John&rsquo;s day, travel
in a state of complete nudity, the paramo of Novagote from one end to
the other, he will be able to get possession of the hidden treasure. In
all these legends, and there are many of them, the Indian has as much
faith as have the children of the North in the fairy stories they hear
in the nursery.</p>
<p>Then there is that &ldquo;strange, harrowing, long-drawn cry, human
in its tones,&rdquo; alleged sometimes to be audible in the depths of
the tropical forests, for which no satisfactory explanation has as yet
been given. The Indians say it is &ldquo;The Cry of a Lost Soul.&rdquo;
The poet Whittier refers to it in the following verses:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;In that black forest where, when day is
done,</p>
<p class="tb">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p class="line">A cry as of the pained heart of the wood,</p>
<p class="line">The long, despairing moan of solitude</p>
<p class="line">And darkness and the absence of all good,</p>
<p class="line">Startles the traveller with a sound so drear,</p>
<p class="line">So full of hopeless agony and fear,</p>
<p class="line">His heart stands still, and listens with his ear.</p>
<p class="line">The guide, as if he heard a death-bell toll,</p>
<p class="line">Crosses himself, and whispers, &lsquo;A Lost
Soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some of their stories, however, seem to have some foundation in
fact. Almost every <i>paramero</i>&mdash;inhabitant of the
paramo&mdash;has a story to tell about seeing lightning or hearing
thunder issue from certain lakes or wells as he was passing by on a
clear night when there was not the slightest indication of rain or
storm. At such times the waters of the lake may become violently
agitated without any apparent cause. One&rsquo;s vaqueano, on being
asked the reason of such a phenomenon, simply replies, &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Est&aacute; brava la laguna</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Truena la laguna</i>&mdash;the lake is disturbed, or
thunders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s answer explains nothing, but the phenomenon seems
to lend itself to an explanation which is as simple as it is natural.
If we suppose these lakes, as we well may, to be in the craters of
extinct volcanoes, in the bottoms of which, owing to slight earth
tremors, rents are made in the rocks that permit the escape of
imprisoned gases, the mystery is at least partially solved. The escape
of gas, in large quantity under great pressure, would account for the
violent agitation of the water. If these gases should become ignited by
the action of the electricity with which, as we have learned, the
summits of the mountains are often very highly charged, we should have
in the flash of the ignited gas what the Indian takes to be lightning,
and in the resulting explosion what he thinks is thunder.</p>
<p>I suggest this view merely as a tentative one, and hope that the
phenomena in question, like those referred to in chapter nine regarding
the luminous displays in the mountain summits, may eventually receive
an explanation that men of science will accept as conclusive. But while
awaiting the final word of empirical science regarding these, and
similar mysterious manifestations of nature, we may, with the simple
Indian, give free rein to our fancy and people the cascades and lakes,
caverns, forests and colossal rock masses with all kinds of
preternatural beings and invest them with the most extraordinary
powers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>To be frank, we were not sorry to get away from the atmosphere of
science, and find a land where the legends and traditions of the people
were akin to those that were the delight of our childhood. For, much as
we love science, we have never been willing to renounce the pleasure of
indulging our imagination, as we did in years long gone by, when the
fairy tale and the myth so captivated our youthful mind. We confess it
freely, we were glad to be among the simple, primitive people of the
Andes, and were deeply interested in their peculiar folklore. It
afforded us, in another form, the pleasure we derived from our first
acquaintance with the creations of Homer, Hesiod and Ovid; and with
such productions as the Niebelungen Lied, Sakuntala, the Knights of the
Round Table and Cid Campeador. All the science, history and philosophy
in the world could not diminish the pleasure we still find in these
creations of fancy. We cherish them as much, if not more, to-day, as we
did when they first became a part of our intellectual life. For this
reason, if for no other, the reader will conceive our unalloyed delight
in being beyond the reach of the reports of physical and psychological
laboratories, wherein nothing is admitted that has not the imprimatur
of Baconian science or Comtian philosophy, both of which lay an
absolute interdict on all the most charming creations of poetry and
romance.</p>
<p>The vista towards the east, as we finally drew near the
<i>cumbre</i>&mdash;the long desired summit of the Andes&mdash;was
beautiful in the extreme. Below us, to the right and to the left, were
a succession of mountain ridges, some still forest-covered, while
others exhibited the smiling gardens, verdant pastures and humble
dwellings of the inhabitants. Here and there was a picturesque little
village of white-washed stone houses in place of the bamboo dwellings
of the llanos and foothills. On all sides were multitudinous streams
and torrents, that had their birth in the snow fields and ice pinnacles
of the highest points of Sumapaz, and which were vying with one another
in their long race <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269"
name="pb269">269</a>]</span>for the broad emerald plains of Casanare
and San Martin.</p>
<p>Above was the clear sapphire-blue sky, save where it was flecked by
fantastic fleeces of glimmering clouds that floated voluptuously among
the lofty peaks of the Cordilleras, and mantled them, in passing, with
their quivering vapors. Then, as if by enchantment, all was changed
with a suddenness that was positively startling. We had reached the
limit of the <i>alisios</i>&mdash;trade winds&mdash;for the Andes form
a rampart which they never pass. Here they are forced to part with the
last drop of the moisture that they have brought from the distant
Atlantic. But, on the occasion of our passage, they seemed determined
to make one last desperate effort to cross the rock-ribbed barrier. As
if marshaled by &AElig;olus himself, the bright, white, cumulous
clouds, those fair flocks of the west wind, were in a moment
transformed into dark, ominous nimbi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible, strange, sublime and beauteous shapes,&rdquo;
which, gathering their forces, dashed with the fury of the hurricane
against the adamantine crest of the Cordilleras. The tempest lasted but
a few minutes, and then all was as bright and serene as before, and, if
anything, more radiantly beautiful.</p>
<p>Here, in a region empyreal, far away from the noise and turmoil of
our marts of commerce, we breathed an air of purity, and experienced a
sense of freedom that are unknown in the dank, foul and malarial
atmosphere in which so many struggling millions pass the greater part
of their wretched lives. But above all, what most impresses one in
these ethereal heights is the sense of the proximity of God. We could
almost fancy some one breathing into our ear the words of
Tennyson:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Speak to Him thou, for He hears, and Spirit can
meet&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and
feet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Traveling from the foothills to the summit of the
Cordilleras is like going from the equator to the arctic circle. One
has every variety of climate peculiar to the torrid, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>temperate and frigid zones, and the fauna and
flora vary with the altitude as they change with the climate.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the Andean regions have long recognized three
distinct climates, known as those of the <i>tierra
caliente</i>&mdash;hot land; the <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i>&mdash;cold
land; and the <i>paramo</i>. Men of science have, for the sake of
convenience, added a third climate, that of the <i>tierra templada</i>,
or temperate land. The altitudes at which these climates are found vary
with the latitude and with certain meteorological conditions, but in
Colombia and near the equator they are quite fixed and accepted as fair
approximations to the truth.</p>
<p><i>Tierra caliente</i> embraces a zone extending from sea level to a
line one thousand meters higher up. It is pre-eminently the land of
palms, ceibas and milk trees; of totumos and tamarinds, of the vanilla
and ipecacuanha; the algarroba and white cedar; the
sarrapia&mdash;<i>Dipteryx odorata</i>&mdash;and the poisonous
curare&mdash;<i>strychnos toxifera</i>&mdash;from which the Indians
make the deadly compound that renders their arrows such certain
messengers of death. It is also the favorite zone for many tropical
fruits such as plantains, bananas, mameys, nisperos, mangos, zapotes,
oranges, lemons, pineapples, and scores of others found only in the
lowlands of the equinoctial regions.</p>
<p>The upper limits of the <i>tierra caliente</i> are indicated by the
disappearance of the cacao tree and certain plants that do not flourish
at an altitude beyond one thousand meters above sea level. The
<i>tierra caliente</i> and the <i>tierra templada</i> are connected by
such well-known plants and trees as sensitive mimosas, bamboos,
cinchonas and tree ferns, although these representatives of the
vegetable world do not attain their full importance until higher
altitudes are reached.</p>
<p>The <i>tierra templada</i> comprises a zone extending from one
thousand to twenty-four hundred meters above sea level. It is in the
lower part of this zone that the bamboo, the most delicate and graceful
of tropical plants, attains <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>its greatest development and gives
its greatest charm to the landscape.</p>
<p>The numerous plants, shrubs and trees of the bean and myrtle
families are seen at their best in the lower half of the <i>tierra
templada</i>. It is here, too, that one meets with the largest and most
beautiful specimens of tree ferns. So gigantic, indeed, are they that
at a distance they are easily mistaken for a moriche palm. Only in the
islands of the Pacific have I ever seen anything to compare with them
in size and luxuriant loveliness.</p>
<p>In this zone the cultivation of coffee replaces that of cacao in the
zone below. I have never seen larger or finer berries anywhere than we
found on the shrubs grown on the eastern declivity of the Cordilleras
near San Miguel. And yet, strange to relate, only a short distance from
this spot, we found it impossible to get a cup of coffee, although we
asked for it at several places. There was chocolate and chicha in
abundance, but no coffee, where it would be, one would think, the most
common beverage. Its absence here reminded us of the difficulty we
found in getting a calabash of milk on the great cattle farms of the
llanos.</p>
<p>At twelve hundred meters above sea level the palm family begins to
lose its importance, although graceful representatives continue to
charm the traveler until he reaches much higher altitudes. But one is,
in a measure, reconciled to the disappearance of palms, that so
delighted one in the lowlands, by the marvelous display made on all
sides by countless species of the convolvulus and gesnerwort families.
Nothing can exceed their exuberance, or their gay and brilliant
flowers, as they mantle the shrubbery by the wayside or peep out from
under the forest trees along one&rsquo;s path.</p>
<p>The flora comprehended in the zone extending from eighteen to
twenty-four hundred meters above the sea is in reality transitional in
its nature, and partakes of the character of both that of the <i>tierra
templada</i> and the <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i>. The various species of
cinchona render this zone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>notable, for it is here and in the
<i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i> that was formerly obtained most of the
quinine of commerce.</p>
<p><i>Tierra fr&iacute;a</i> extends from twenty-four hundred to three
thousand meters above sea level. Its vegetation, as would be expected,
is entirely different from that of the hot plains and temperate valleys
of the lowlands. One no longer sees the elegant forms of the plantain
and the bamboo, nor the majestic palm and ceiba, nor the graceful and
flexible bejucos and creepers of hotter climes. But, notwithstanding
the absence of all these charming representatives of Flora, it cannot
be said of the vegetation of <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i> that it is
either poor or devoid of importance. Its dark hardy foliage, may, if
you will, give it the impress of solemnity and melancholy, but the
herbs, shrubs and trees are remarkable, not only for the number of
their species, but also for the beauty of their inflorescence and the
variety and importance of their products. Here flourish the noble red
cedar and the white caoutchouc tree that supplies to commerce the
highly valued rubber known as the <i>Virgen del Para</i>.</p>
<p>The products of our northern lands, such as wheat, barley and
potatoes, and such fruits&mdash;all of foreign origin&mdash;as the
peach, pear, cherry and apple, together with a number of valuable
garden vegetables, are cultivated in this zone, and with marked
success.</p>
<p>The most important, and in some respects the most remarkable plant
of the tropics is Indian corn&mdash;<i>zea mais</i>. It is cultivated
in all the zones from the hot plains of <i>tierra caliente</i> to the
upper regions of <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i> and constitutes, in one form
or another, the chief food-supply of the inhabitants. There is,
however, a striking difference in the time required for the plant to
reach maturity at the different altitudes. In the hot climates it is
often ready for the harvest in two months after planting&mdash;when
several crops a year are obtainable&mdash;whereas in the cold uplands
it requires nearly a year to mature.</p>
<p>All the land between the <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i> and the region of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>perpetual snow is called the paramo. It
corresponds to the puna of Peru, Bolivia and Northern Chili. In some
parts of Colombia the paramos are bleak, treeless plains, often
enveloped in dark, cold fogs, or swept by keen blasts of almost arctic
severity. In other parts, they are covered by a hardy Alpine
vegetation, together with grasses and mosses of different species. The
most interesting growths are strange-looking ferns and the woolly
Frailejon&mdash;Espeletia grandiflora&mdash;which Sievers well
designates as the character-plant of the paramos. The name, Frailejon,
signifies a big monk, and was given the plant by the inhabitants on
account of the fancied resemblance of its felt-like covering to a
monk&rsquo;s hood. It is usually from six to eight feet high, but it
frequently attains a much greater altitude. It is one of those odd
forms of vegetation that once seen are never forgotten.</p>
<p>No mere account, however, of the wonderful changes witnessed in
passing from lower to higher altitudes can give any idea of the effect
produced on the traveler. Every hour&mdash;yea, every minute&mdash;on
his upward journey, he is greeted by new forms of vegetable life and
must needs at the same time bid farewell to others that may not
accompany him beyond their own proper zones. But, although
Flora&rsquo;s children are ever changing, they are always beautiful and
it would be difficult for the botanist to say where they challenge the
most admiration&mdash;in the hot plains of the Orinoco and the Meta or
high up on the cheerless and inhospitable paramo.</p>
<p>What we found most astonishing in our three-days journey from the
llanos to the crest of the Cordilleras was the extraordinary number and
diversity of forms of plant life. While we, in our northern woodlands,
do well if we can find a score of different species of trees in the
space of a square mile, we may, within the same limits in a tropical
forest, count species by the hundred. Every few rods, on our way from
Villavicencio to the <i>cumbre</i> of the Andes, we noted the
appearance of some new species of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274"
href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>plant, shrub or tree; some
strange vine or epiphyte; some fruit or blossom which we had not
observed before.</p>
<p>Great as were the physical and meteorological changes observable
between the <i>tierra caliente</i> and the paramo, those of the
vegetable world were still greater. At times, during our rapid ascent
from lower to higher altitudes, from llanos to paramo, the changes in
species were so rapid and kaleidoscopic, the transitions so sudden and
unexpected, that our brains were in a whirl and we had to give up in
despair the attempt to keep anything approaching a record of the order
of sequence of the countless vegetable forms encountered along our
path. Considering solely the successive changes in flora and
temperature, our experience in climbing the Cordilleras was like that
which would result from a three-days journey overland from the sultry
valley of the Amazon to the gold-bearing strands of the Yukon or to the
distant shores of the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>It was a little after midday when we finally reached the paramo of
Chipaque&mdash;that dread paramo of which we had so frequently heard so
many and so extraordinary tales. It was, we had been told, a place of
eternal frost and snow, and of blasts so tempestuous that both men and
animals were sometimes picked up bodily and hurled into a yawning gorge
near the dizzy height which we were obliged to pass. We soon
discovered, however, that most of the stories we had heard of this and
similar paramos, had but little foundation in fact, or were greatly
exaggerated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6136src" href="#xd21e6136"
name="xd21e6136src">5</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>To begin with, we found neither frost nor snow. As a matter of fact,
snow rarely falls in this paramo. All about us there was an abundance
of vegetation that little comported with the region of arctic
temperature. We found there a number of peasants&rsquo; huts and a
large drove of cattle, that were on their way from the llanos to the
Bogat&aacute; market. It took them more than two weeks to make a
journey that we had made in three days. But both the cattle and their
drivers&mdash;<i>vaqueros</i>&mdash;were more sensitive to cold than we
were. For this reason, they had to proceed slowly to accustom
themselves to the lower temperature and the higher altitude. The
peasants living on the paramo, although lightly clad, did not seem to
be affected by the cold. The vaqueros, however, who had come from the
lowlands, seemed to suffer greatly. But no wonder. They made no
provision for so great a change of climate. They wore the same light
garments&mdash;probably they had nothing else&mdash;in crossing the
Cordilleras, that they had used in the ever-heated llanos. It was not
strange, then, that they should give exaggerated accounts of the cold
of the paramo or of the suffering it induces. It would be surprising if
it were otherwise.</p>
<p>It requires less than half an hour to cross the paramo&mdash;so
limited is it in area&mdash;and reach the Boquer&oacute;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6155src" href="#xd21e6155" name=
"xd21e6155src">6</a>&mdash;the name given the short artificial cut,
only a few rods in length&mdash;through the crest of the Andes. At this
highest point our thermometer registered 48&deg; F., and the aneroid, a
fine compensated instrument, indicated an altitude of ten thousand five
hundred and sixty feet. This is but little higher than Leadville,
Colo., and considerably lower than some of the railway passes over the
Rocky Mountains. The temperature, owing to the light atmosphere, was so
mild, that we did not even think of throwing our ponchos <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>over
our shoulders, as a protection from the cold that the poor Llanero felt
so keenly.</p>
<p>As we were passing through the Boquer&oacute;n we were joined by a
young hacendado who had a cattle farm in the neighborhood. After a
friendly greeting he remarked, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Est&aacute;
sumamente fr&iacute;a</i>&rdquo;&mdash;It is extremely cold. And then,
thinking we were too lightly clad, he said almost pleadingly,
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Cubranse con sus bayetones, otramente se saca una
pulmonia</i>.&rdquo; Put on your bayetones, otherwise you will get
pneumonia. Then he related how, the preceding year, he had crossed this
pass in a snow storm, contracted pneumonia, was confined to his bed for
months, and barely escaped a premature death.</p>
<p>While he was thus addressing us, a number of Llaneros passed by on
their way from Bogot&aacute; to their homes in the warm plains near
Villavicencio. In addition to the usual covering for the head they had
their ears and face protected by a kind of kerchief and seemed to
suffer more from the cold than our hardy northerners would in a Dakota
blizzard. Poor fellows! We pitied them. They were shivering, their
teeth were chattering and they were evidently in great distress. But
the reason was manifest at a glance. Aside from their head gear, they
had nothing on except a pair of short trousers of flimsy material and a
light poncho. They were barefooted, and, to judge from their wan and
pinched features, they were suffering from hunger as well as from
cold.</p>
<p>We had now discovered the origin of the reports so generally
accepted as true in the llanos, regarding the intense cold of the
paramos and of the various Andean passes. Those poor, shivering,
ill-clad, half-famished peons explained all. The same causes evidently
operated in occasioning the great mortality suffered by Bolivar&rsquo;s
army when it passed, in 1819, from the llanos of the Apure to the
<i>altiplanicies</i>&mdash;high tablelands&mdash;of New
Granada.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6175src" href="#xd21e6175" name=
"xd21e6175src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277"
name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>The paramo of Pisva, through which the Republican army invaded the
enemy&rsquo;s country, is less than thirteen thousand<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6186src" href="#xd21e6186" name="xd21e6186src">8</a> feet
above sea level, and the passage, therefore, of the Cordilleras, at
this point, was not in itself the difficult undertaking it is so often
represented to have been. The frightful loss of life, usually
attributed to the intense cold of Pisva Pass, was, in reality, due to
the fact that Bolivar&rsquo;s followers were not properly prepared for
the campaign in which they were engaged. They were half-naked and
half-starved and the wonder is that the hapless army did not suffer far
greater losses than those actually recorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The army endured many sufferings in the passage of the
paramo,&rdquo; writes Vergara y Velasco, &ldquo;but it is a grave error
to compare them with those incurred in the passage of the Alps by
Hannibal and Napoleon or in the passage of the Chilean Andes by San
Martin, for in Pisva there is no snow, neither is the altitude so great
as that of many frequented places in our Cordilleras. The expedition,
without having the romance of the others, nevertheless equals them in
results and for the same reason&mdash;the ineptitude of the
enemy.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6194src" href="#xd21e6194"
name="xd21e6194src">9</a></p>
<p>The first thing that attracted our attention, on reaching the
western end of the Boquer&oacute;n, was the large number of flowers, of
divers species, that bedecked both sides of our path. They constituted
a carpet of the most brilliant hues that, with a lovely green boscage,
extended to the very summit of the mountain crest. In form and beauty
they were not unlike the charming blooms that gladden our forests
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>and meadows in May and June. There was this
difference, however, that the number of species in a given space was
far greater than is ever found in the same space in our northern
climes. Does this close juxtaposition of so many species in the tropics
contribute to the more rapid formation of varieties and new species
than is possible in higher latitudes, where species are fewer and more
widely separated from one another? It would seem so.</p>
<p>We shall never forget the panorama that burst upon our vision as we
made our exit from the Boquer&oacute;n. It was in such marked contrast
with the view which we had so much admired on the eastern side. On the
east side all was verdure, bloom, and grateful shrubbery, with
occasional clumps of trees. On the western declivity, with the
exception of a narrow reach, already mentioned, near the mountain
crest, all was as treeless and as bare and arid as the sandy plains of
Nevada or Arizona.</p>
<p>But the entire western slope and distant plateau was bathed in
bright sunshine. Not a single cloud flecked the azure canopy above us,
and not a single sound, except the muffled footsteps of our horses,
disturbed the quiet and serenity of our exalted outlook. We were
standing on the crest of the Eastern Cordillera&mdash;the range to
which the people of the country have long given the poetical name of
Suma Paz&mdash;Supreme Peace.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6208src" href=
"#xd21e6208" name="xd21e6208src">10</a> Owing to its proximity to the
capital, where it is always in view, it doubtless impressed the popular
fancy more than did the more distant, although loftier and more
imposing, snow-capped masses of Ruiz and Tolima. Seen from
Bogot&aacute;, this beautiful range, when tinged with the golden
crimson rays of the setting sun, might well appear as an Olympus, the
abode of the gods in the enjoyment of eternal peace. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are some geographers who contend that the Cordillera of Suma
Paz is the continuation of the principal chain of the Andes, but, as it
terminates in the adjoining Republic of Venezuela, it seems more
reasonable to maintain that the Western Cordillera is entitled to this
distinction. It is the western range, which, after passing through the
Isthmus of Panama, reappears as the Sierra Madre of Mexico and as the
Rocky Mountains of North America, and continues its course, almost
without interruption, to Bering&rsquo;s Strait.</p>
<p>It is, however, the Sierra de Suma Paz which separates the two great
hydrographic basins of the Orinoco and the Magdalena. We saw tiny
rivulets, almost at the instant of their birth, and only a few spans
from one another, beginning simultaneously their long journey to the
broad Magdalena to the west and to the mighty Orinoco in the distant
east. Some were to visit the lands which we had already traversed,
others were to pass through a country that still lay before us, but
which we hoped to explore in the very near future.</p>
<p>Although Suma Paz had long been one of the objective points of our
peregrinations, we could not leave it without mingled feelings of
regret and sadness. It stood between us and many delightful scenes and
marked the passing of many delightful days that could never return.
There was also, of course, a feeling of relief experienced, for we had
happily completed the most arduous part of our journey and that, too,
without encountering a single one of the many difficulties and dangers
that had been predicted when in Trinidad and Ciudad Bolivar we
announced our intention of going to Bogot&aacute; over the route whose
last lap we were completing.</p>
<p>From the spot where we halted to pluck a few flowers at the mouth of
the Boquer&oacute;n, as a souvenir of our first passage of the Andes,
we could almost catch a glimpse towards the northwest, of the churches
and public edifices of Colombia&rsquo;s capital. There was one of the
celebrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>camping-grounds of some of the most noted of the
Conquistadores and thither we would hasten with the minimum of delay.
We loved to think that Federmann had crossed the Cordilleras just where
we did. It is certain that, if he did not cross them at this point, it
was not far distant from it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6222src" href=
"#xd21e6222" name="xd21e6222src">11</a> All the way from Villavicencio
we felt that we were following in his footsteps, as we had been
following in the footsteps of other conquistadores from the time we had
trod the romantic soil of Tierra Florida. We had, near the foothills of
the Cordilleras, in the neighborhood of Buena Vista, crossed the path
of Hernan P&eacute;rez de Quesada, who almost made the circuit of New
Granada in his memorable quest of El Dorado, and we were likely to
cross it again before reaching Bogot&aacute;, for on his return from
his expedition, he, as well as Federmann, must have entered the city
near where we did ourselves.</p>
<p>Before leaving our posada at Caqueza we asked a certain Colombian
general how long it took to make the trip to Bogot&aacute;. His reply
was, &ldquo;<i lang="es">Cinco horas sin mujeres</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Five
hours without women. To our surprise the women present made no protest
against this unchivalrous reflection on their horsemanship. Probably,
not being accustomed to riding, they felt that his statement was true,
and that it was unwise to call it in question. Had some of our dashing
American horsewomen been present, it is most likely <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>that
the implied challenge would have provoked a spirited retort.</p>
<p>But whatever the women present may have thought, we subsequently had
reason to believe that the man was wrong, but for a reason different
from the one he had given. After leaving Caqueza we had pushed forward
towards the Boquer&oacute;n as rapidly as our horses&mdash;and they
were good animals&mdash;could make their way over the terrible path up
the mountain, and it took us more than five hours to reach that point.
Judging from our experience it would have required an extraordinary
strong and spirited horse to carry a man, over such a road as we had to
traverse, to Bogat&aacute; in five hours even <i>sin mujeres</i>.</p>
<p>Our path, during the first few miles down the western declivity of
the Suma Paz, was quite as bad as it had been anywhere on the eastern
slope. After, however, we had reached the plateau, about fifteen
hundred feet below the Boquer&oacute;n, the road became much better and
our mounts could make far better time than was before possible.
Notwithstanding the energy expended in crossing the crest of the Andes,
they were still in fine fettle, and it was only necessary to give them
a loose rein to have them break into a lively gallop, which they seemed
to be able to keep up indefinitely with but little effort.</p>
<p>There was not much of interest to note on this part of the way
except, perhaps, some remarkable effects of erosion near the road a
short distance from the capital. The hard, compact earth was here
carved by the action of rain and running water into the same fantastic
forms, often resembling dolmens and cromlechs, that characterize the
Badlands of South Dakota. We regretted that we were unable to take some
photographs of them, as a number of the formations were of special
geological importance.</p>
<p>The first indication of our near approach to Bogat&aacute; was a
two-wheeled cart, drawn by a yoke of oxen, which we passed near the
suburbs of the city. It was the first wheeled vehicle we had seen since
leaving Ciudad Bolivar. Further <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282"
href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>on we were
startled&mdash;and, I may add, delighted&mdash;by the piercing sound of
a locomotive whistle. It came from an engine on one of the short
railroads that centre in Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>At last we were getting back&mdash;I will not say to
civilization&mdash;but to where the material evidences of civilisation
were more numerous than they had been anywhere on our journey since we
had taken our departure from the Port-of-Spain. As we got still nearer
the city, we met a cavalcade of horsemen who were out for their evening
ride. It was here that we saw, for the first time in Colombia, a
thoroughfare worthy of the name. Our bonny steeds, trusty and true,
seemed to appreciate the improvement in the road as much as we did
ourselves. And, as if put on their mettle by the curveting steeds we
had just passed, they, like the fleet mules of Nausicaa,
&ldquo;gathered up their nimble feet,&rdquo; and almost before we
realized it we were in the streets of Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>It was then a matter of only a few minutes to our hotel, where we
found comforts and conveniences to which we had long been strangers. It
was just eight hours since we had left our modest posada in Caqueza,
with its simple fare and hard board cot, and now we suddenly found
ourselves installed in richly furnished apartments, with brilliant
electric lights and an excellent cuisine. The sudden change in our
environment seemed like an incident in the <i>Arabian Nights</i> rather
than a reality in which we were personally concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were you ever able to make such a trip?&rdquo; queried a
German traveler, shortly after our arrival. I had made all arrangements
to go with a friend from Bogot&aacute; to Ciudad Bolivar, but after all
was ready, I was dissuaded by my friends from undertaking a journey on
which I had so long set my heart. They assured me that the trip would
be so difficult and beset with so many dangers of all kinds that I
would run the risk of losing health, and even life, if I persisted in
my purpose. Only at the last moment, when they told me that the roads
were absolutely impassable at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>this season of the year, did
I give up a project that I had so long cherished. How I envy you. But
it is too late now for me to reconsider my plans, as I must return to
Germany in a few days, and with the knowledge that, against my better
judgment, I was forced to forego the most interesting part of my
itinerary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, we had indeed been fortunate in our wanderings. In the
expressive language of a West Indian negro servant, whom we had for a
while in Venezuela, we had always been &ldquo;good-lucky, never
bad-lucky.&rdquo; We had no adventures to record and never once felt
that we were in presence of danger. We never carried weapons of any
kind and at no time was there any need for them. During our entire
journey, through plains and among mountains, we felt quite as safe as
if we had been taking a promenade down Broadway or Fifth Avenue, New
York. Roughing it agreed with us perfectly and, far from suffering from
exposure or fatigue, we found ourselves in the enjoyment of better
health at the completion of our journey than at the beginning. Despite
all predictions to the contrary, we had escaped all</p>

</div>
<p class="first">and had reached Colombia&rsquo;s capital, ready, after
a few days&rsquo; rest, to enter upon even a longer and a more arduous
journey than the one that we had just so happily terminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you not fear sickness on your way?&rdquo; asked
another German, who had gone over some of the ground we had just
traversed, and who seemed to entertain anything but pleasant
recollections of his experience. &ldquo;When I traveled in the
interior, far away from doctors and medical assistance of every kind, I
was continually haunted by the thought of contracting fever or some
other dread tropical disease. What would you have done if you had been

saying that &ldquo;The Lord takes care of his own,&rdquo; so we
answered in the words of Lucan,</p>

According to the Chibchas, the fossil remains found here were the bones
of a race of giants, hence the name given the locality. Humboldt and
Cuvier, at the beginning of the last century, showed that the larger
bones found were the remains of the <i>Mastodon angustidens</i>.
Similar fossils found in other parts of South America have given rise
to like fables. Cieza de Leon devotes an interesting chapter to a race
of giants whose remains were found at Point Santa Helena, near
Guayaquil. And on the tradition of a race of giants, that at one time
landed at this place, a certain Mr. Ranking, in 1827, published a
fantastic book entitled <i>Researches on the Conquest of Peru and
Mexico by the Mongols, accompanied with Elephants</i>. See <i>La

&ldquo;According to what the inhabitants told me,&rdquo; wrote Mollien,
in the early part of the last century, &ldquo;when the <i>paramo se
pone bravo</i> is out of humor, then the greatest dangers threaten the
traveler; a wind laden with icy vapors blows with tremendous violence;
thick darkness covers the earth and conceals every trace of a road. The
birds which, on the appearance of a fine day, had attempted the
passage, fall motionless. The traveler seeks to shelter himself under
the stunted shrubs which here and there grow in these deserts; but
their wet foliage obliges him to find another covert. Worn out with
fatigue and hunger, in vain urging on his mules, benumbed with cold, he
sits down to recover his exhausted strength. Fatal repose! His stomach
soon becomes affected as when at sea, his blood freezes in his veins;
his muscles grow stiff, his lips open as if to smile, and he expires
with the expression of joy upon his features. The mules, no longer
hearing their master&rsquo;s voice, remain standing, till at length
tired, they lie down to die.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Travels in the Republic of

According to Vergara y Velasco, the name Suma Paz is of Indian, and not
of Spanish origin. If this be true, the name should be written as one
word&mdash;Sumapaz. Personally, I prefer to think the name is Spanish.
For this particular range it is a most appropriate
epithet.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e6208src">&uarr;</a></p>

Simon says that Federmann, after crossing the Cordillera, tarried for a
while in the province of Pasca. Castellanos declares it was in the
pueblo of Pasca, a small town a short distance south of our route.
According to Vergara y Velasco, the adventurous German conquistador
entered &ldquo;the Sabana of Bogat&aacute; by way of Pasca and
Usme.&rdquo; Usme is a village that is on the road along which we
passed. Col. Joaquin Acosta tells us the Cordillera was crossed in the
broadest and most rugged part, &ldquo;where even to-day the most daring
hunters scarcely ever venture. Neither before nor since Federmann have
horses scaled the craggy crests of Pascote and crossed the heights of
Suma Paz and descended thence to Pasca in the valley of
Fusagasuga.&rdquo; Oviedo informs us that it required twenty-two days
to cross the <i>paramos</i>, which was so extremely cold that sixteen
horses were frozen to death. But whether Federmann crossed Suma Paz
where we did or, as some think, at a point farther south, it is
reasonable to suppose that his route from Villavicencio to
Bogat&aacute; was practically the same as our own.&nbsp;<a class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ATHENS OF SOUTH AMERICA</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the beginning of August, 1538, Gonzalo Jimenez de
Quesada, the conqueror of Cundinmarca, and his followers, after one of
the most remarkable campaigns ever conducted in the New World,
assembled on the present site of Bogat&aacute;. Here Quesada dismounted
from his charger, and plucking up some grass by the roots, he announced
that he took possession of that land in the name of the Emperor Charles
V. Having remounted his steed, he drew his sword, and challenged any
one to oppose this formal declaration, which, he declared, he was
prepared to defend at all hazards. As no one appeared to contest his
action, he sheathed his sword, and directed the army notary to make an
official record of what had just been accomplished.</p>
<p>Bogot&aacute; was then but a rude village, or, rather, a camp, of a
dozen hastily constructed huts which barely sufficed to shelter the
intrepid sons of Spain. Besides these twelve huts&mdash;erected in
memory of the twelve apostles&mdash;there had also been constructed a
small wooden, thatch-covered church, on the very site occupied by the
present imposing cathedral of Colombia&rsquo;s fair capital. The first
mass was said in this church the sixth day of August, a few days after
the ceremony of occupation just mentioned&mdash;and this is regarded as
the legal date of the foundation of Bogot&aacute;. It was then that the
work of the conquest was technically considered as finished. The work
of colonization was to follow without delay.</p>
<p>It was then that Quesada gave to the future city the name of Santa
F&eacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6312src" href="#xd21e6312" name=
"xd21e6312src">1</a> Being from Granada, he named the country
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>he had discovered and conquered Nuevo Reino de
Granada&mdash;the New Kingdom of Granada&mdash;an appellation it
retained until after the War of Independence, when it received the name
it now bears.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, a striking similarity between the elevated
plateau, watered by the Funza, and the charming vega of Granada,
fertilized by the romantic Genil. To one looking towards the west, from
a spur of the mountain at the foot of which Bogot&aacute; is situated,
as Granada is located at the foot of its hills, the ridge of Suba is
seen towards the northwest, just as the sierra of Elvira is seen with
respect to the old Moorish capital. And so it is with the relative
positions of Santa F&eacute; en la Vega and the pueblo of Fontibon. The
illusion is complete, and the similarity between these two famous
places in Spain and Colombia must have impressed themselves on the
receptive mind of the illustrious conquistador with peculiar force.
Even the heights of Suacha, in aspect and position, recall the famous
hill which is known as the <i>Suspiro del Moro</i> from the lament of
Boabdil, the last king of Granada, whose tears evoked from his mother,
the intrepid Sultana, Ayxa la Horra, the caustic words, &ldquo;<i lang=
"es">Bien hace en llorar como mujer lo que como hombre no supo
defender</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6328src" href=
"#xd21e6328" name="xd21e6328src">2</a></p>
<p>Santa F&eacute;, also known as Santa F&eacute; de Bogot&aacute;, was
for a long period the capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. After
the War of Independence the name was changed to
Bogot&aacute;&mdash;from Bacat&aacute;&mdash;the name of the old
Chibcha capital, where the zipa, the most powerful of the Indian
caciques, at the arrival of the Spaniards, had his official residence.
The city is nearly two miles in length and of varying breadth. Its
present population is nearly one hundred and twenty-five thousand. It
is situated on a western spur of the great Cordillera of Suma Paz at an
elevation, according to Reiss and St&uuml;bel, of eight thousand six
hundred and sixteen feet above sea level&mdash;more than <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>half
a mile higher than the summit of Mt. Washington, the highest point in
New England.</p>

</div>
<p>The mean annual temperature is 60&deg; F., but, owing to the rarity
of the atmosphere, and to its being shielded from the wind by the
mountains at whose base it is situated, it seems to be higher than
this. During certain seasons of the year one may experience a
penetrating cold, as long as one remains in the shade, but when one
passes into the sunshine it becomes almost uncomfortably warm. During
the rainy season, the newcomer feels the cold very keenly, but, after a
short residence in the city, one becomes acclimated and then fancies
that he is in the enjoyment of perpetual spring.</p>
<p>We were in Bogot&aacute; in the early part of June, during which
time it rained every day. Coming directly from the <i>tierra
caliente</i>, we suffered considerably, especially at night, from the
low temperature and the dampness that prevailed. We were, however,
informed by the natives that the season was unusually severe, and that
such bad weather as we encountered was quite unusual: Velasco y Vergara
&mdash;a Colombian&mdash;tells that it rains the greater part of the
year, and that the sky is almost always covered by clouds.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6351src" href="#xd21e6351" name="xd21e6351src">3</a>
For this reason, the houses suffer from humidity, and rheumatism and
kindred complaints are very prevalent. Otherwise the climate is
considered salubrious.</p>
<p>Bogot&aacute;&mdash;called by the aborigines Bacat&aacute;&mdash;is
a city in a state of transition. It has lost, almost entirely, the
medi&aelig;val, monastic, mozarabic aspect that characterized it while
it was the tranquil court of the viceroys. But, great as has been the
change that it has undergone during the last few decades, it preserves
much of the quaintness of colonial times. Indeed, it is not difficult,
in certain parts of the city, to fancy oneself carried back to a
typical Spanish town of the time of Charles V or Philip II. As a whole,
however, the Bogot&aacute; of to-day does not differ materially in
appearance from a city of the same size in Spain or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>Mexico. All Latin-American cities are similar in
their leading features, and when you have seen one you have seen
all.</p>
<p>The city is adorned by a number of broad and beautiful streets and
several plazas and parks. Aside from a few government buildings, the
edifices that attract most attention are the monasteries and churches.
The cathedral is a noble building and compares favorably with any
similar structure in South America. The interior had just been
artistically painted and gilded, at the time of our visit, and it
reminded us somewhat of the exquisite finish of St. John Lateran, in
Rome. An object of interest to the traveler, within these sacred
precincts, is the tomb of the illustrious conquistador, Gonzalo Jimenez
de Quesada.</p>
<p>The residences of the people are usually two stories high, with a
balcony on the second story facing the street. All of the older houses,
as well as many of the modern ones, are of the well-known Moorish style
of architecture, with a single large
entrance&mdash;<i>porton</i>&mdash;and a
<i>patio</i>&mdash;courtyard&mdash;or two, on which the rooms open.
This style of building is well adapted to tropical climates. It is
comfortable and secures the maximum of privacy. It is in reality, as
well as in fiction, the owner&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>We were surprised to see the number of foreign flowers grown in
these patios. One would naturally expect to find representatives of the
rich and beautiful Colombian flora, but the ladies of Bogot&aacute;
seem to prefer the exotic blooms of the temperate zone. We found roses,
camellias, pinks and geraniums in abundance, but rarely any of those
floral beauties that had so frequently excited our admiration on the
way from the llanos to the capital. Our hotel, however, was a notable
exception to this rule. Here we were delighted with a veritable
exhibition of orchids of many species and of the most wonderful forms
and colors. Among them were some truly splendid specimens of oncidiums,
cattleyas and odontoglossums. It was then we thought of some of our
orchid-loving friends of New York, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289"
href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>who would have fairly reveled
in such marvels of Flora&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>As nearly all the streets are paved with cobblestones, driving is
anything but a pleasure. As a matter of fact, the only passable drive
in the city is the one that leads to the charming little suburb of
Chapinero. This is one of the show places of Bogot&aacute;, and its
houses are in marked contrast with those found in the older part of the
city. Most of them are entirely different in style from the enclosed
Moorish structures of which mention has been made. Here one is
introduced to cozy Swiss chalets in the midst of delightful flower
gardens and picturesque French chateaux, that carry one back to the
Seine and the Loire.</p>
<p>Aside from the churches and monasteries, many of which have been
converted into government offices, there were two buildings that
possessed a special interest for us. One of these was the old Colegio
del Rosario&mdash;now known as the School of Philosophy and
Letters&mdash;founded in 1553, nearly a hundred years before the
University of Harvard. This institution has long been fondly spoken of
by the people of Bogot&aacute; as the country&rsquo;s special
glory&mdash;<i>la gloria de la patria</i>. The other building was the
astronomical observatory&mdash;the first intertropical structure of the
kind&mdash;erected in 1803. After the observatory of Quito, it is said
to be the highest in the world.</p>
<p>Some of the streets and houses have been recently lighted by
electricity, but as yet horses or mules are used as the motive power
for the few street cars that traverse the principal thoroughfares. It
were easy to count the number of private carriages in the city. The
only ones we saw were those of the archbishop and the president of the
republic. Indeed, so rough are the streets that most people prefer
walking to using cabs, except in cases of necessity.</p>
<p>The first two objects to arrest our attention, as we approached
Bogot&aacute; from the south, were the chapels of Guadalupe and
Monserrate, the former nearly twenty-two <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>hundred feet above
the city, and the latter about two hundred feet lower. Perched high
upon the flanks of two picturesque mountain peaks, they are conspicuous
objects from all parts of the Savanna. Both of these sanctuaries are
reached by a foot path, but, as yet, no attempt has been made to
connect them with the city by a carriage road. Owing to the altitude
above sea level of these places, a pilgrimage to them is quite a
task&mdash;especially to the newcomer, who is unaccustomed to the rare
atmosphere of the locality. But the magnificent view afforded one from
either of these elevated shrines well repays all the effort required to
reach them. It is, in some respects, the most beautiful to be found in
the whole of Colombia. And then, there are besides certain historical
features connected with the panorama spread out before one that make it
doubly interesting.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the church of Guadalupe, we have before us the
beautiful Savanna of Bogot&aacute;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6388src"
href="#xd21e6388" name="xd21e6388src">4</a>&mdash;a fertile plain, nine
hundred square kilometers in area. Humboldt, whose opinion has been
adopted by many subsequent writers, regarded this level stretch of land
as the bottom of a lake that formerly existed here, but recent
investigators have called this view in question. Strangely enough, the
Chibcha Indians, at the time of the conquest, had a tradition that the
Savanna was at one time occupied by a lake, but that Bochica, child of
the sun, drained its waters by giving them an exit through the
celebrated falls of Tequendama.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6391src"
href="#xd21e6391" name="xd21e6391src">5</a> The general appearance of
the plain, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>well as certain geological features, seemed to
confirm this tradition, and it was not until quite recently that any
one ventured to express a doubt about the tradition, or the
long-accepted opinion of the great German savant.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the Savanna is covered by a mist, as often
happens, the observer from Monserrate or Guadalupe does indeed seem to
be looking down upon a vast lake. The hills, which here and there rise
above the fog, look like islands and strengthen the illusion. But this
effect is all dissipated as soon as the sun makes his appearance above
the crest of Suma Paz. One then has before him one of the most lovely
panoramas in the world. The wide verdant expanse is intersected with
rivers and streams, all tributaries of the Funza, and dotted with towns
and hamlets and haciendas, lakes and lakelets, large herds of cattle,
flocks of sheep, troops of horses, mules and burros. All this is
enclosed by lofty ramparts of gneiss and granite, which shield the
inhabitants of city and plain from the tempestuous moisture-laden winds
that would otherwise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292"
name="pb292">292</a>]</span>often sweep over the Savanna with the fury
of a Kansas cyclone.</p>
<p>Aside from the Eucalyptus and Humboldt oak&mdash;<i>Quercus
Humboldtii</i>&mdash;there are no large trees in the Savanna of
Bogot&aacute;. The Eucalyptus, however, is everywhere visible, in the
streets and in the gardens of the capital, along the thoroughfares of
the country and around every house, however humble, and quinta, as far
as the eye can reach. These trees were introduced from Australia only a
few decades ago, and now one finds them in all parts of the republic.
We saw them all along our route from the llanos to Bogat&aacute;. The
people, especially those living on the eastern slopes of the Oriental
Andes, are firmly convinced that their presence wards off
<i>paludismo</i>&mdash;malaria&mdash;and, as a consequence, they are
considered as indispensable around the house as the plantain or
calabash tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6416src" href="#xd21e6416"
name="xd21e6416src">6</a></p>
<p>There is nothing more delightful than a stroll along the Rio San
Francisco, which flows between Monserrate and Guadalupe and thence
through the city of Bogot&aacute;. The scenery is thoroughly Alpine in
character and, at times, picturesque beyond description. As one follows
the narrow path, always near the musical, crystal waters of the
impetuous stream, one is delighted at every step by the appearance of
some new flower of brightest hue, or some strange shrub of richest
foliage. The ground is fairly carpeted with anemones, hepatic&aelig;,
gentians, valerians, geraniums, campanul&aelig;, lupines and
buttercups. Like similar plants on the Alps, and on the heights of our
Rockies, their stems are very short and they seem like so many rosettes
attached to the earth, or the rocks that rise up on both sides of our
narrow path.</p>
<p>One sees well illustrated here the dividing line between
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>the flora of the paramo and that of the
<i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i>. The plants of the latter creep up timidly
from the Savanna until a certain point, and then, as if afraid to
venture further into the region of frost, halt on the lower edge of the
paramo. In a similar manner the plants of the higher altitudes
cautiously descend to the upper belt of the <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i>
and there come to a standstill. They meet on a common zone in limited
numbers, but this zone is often extremely narrow. One of the agreeable
surprises to the traveler in the Andes is to note the sudden and
extraordinary changes in the character of the vegetation as he ascends
or descends the mountain near the line of demarcation between two
zones.</p>
<p>The plateau of Guadalupe is the home of two remarkable tree ferns.
One of these is the <i>Cyathea patens</i>, from ten to twelve feet
high, with a beautiful, umbrella-shaped crown. The other is the
<i>Dicksonia gigantea</i>, which, according to the naturalist, Karsten,
is probably the most vigorous and luxuriant tree fern in South America.
Its massive, columnar trunk bears forty and more dark-green fronds,
from three to four feet wide and from six to seven in length. To get a
close view of even one of these noble cryptogams fully repays one for
the arduous climb up to its favorite habitat.</p>
<p>Any city in the United States or Europe, having in its immediate
vicinity such attractions as has Bogot&aacute;, would immediately put
them within easy reach of the public. Thus both Monserrate and
Guadalupe would, without delay, be connected with the city by a
funicular railway, and near by would be a number of restaurants and
pleasure resorts.</p>
<p>An electric railway would also be constructed to the great water
falls of Tequendama&mdash;the largest in Colombia and among the most
celebrated in South America. Although only thirty-six feet wide, the
main fall is three times the height of Niagara Falls.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6447src" href="#xd21e6447" name="xd21e6447src">7</a> But the
volume of water carried <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>over the precipice of Tequendama
is incomparably less than that which plunges into the colossal
whirlpool of Niagara. In appearance it somewhat resembles Vernal Falls
in the Yosemite Valley, or the lower fall of the Yellowstone. What,
however, gives to the Colombian cataract a beauty all its own is its
setting of luxuriant tropical vegetation. In this respect our northern
waterfalls, however attractive they may be in other respects, cannot be
compared with Tequendama.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may seem, but few Colombians have ever seen the
falls of Tequendama. Although the people of Bogot&aacute; love to talk
about them, as among the greatest wonders of their country, it is
rarely that one is found who has actually visited them. And yet they
are not more than twelve miles from the capital. Even the peons living
on the plains only a few miles from the cataract can give the traveler
little or no information as to the best way to reach them. How
different this would all be if the place were easy of access, and if
the visitor, on arriving there, could find the creature comforts to be
obtained in similar places in the United States and Europe!</p>
<p>I have alluded to the interesting historical associations connected
with the city and plateau of Bogot&aacute;. It will suffice to speak of
but one of them; but this one is so remarkable that it is like a
chapter taken from the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. I refer to the meeting of
the three distinguished conquistadores, Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada,
Nicholas Federmann and Sebastian de Belalcazar.</p>
<p>Quesada had left Santa Marta in 1536, having under his command,
according to Oviedo, eight hundred men and one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>hundred horses. He went part of the way by land
and part by the Rio Grande, now known as the Magdalena. After reaching
the Opon, he followed that river as far as it was navigable, and
eventually made his way to the plateau of Bogot&aacute;&mdash;the land
of the Chibchas.</p>
<p>His march was, in some respects, the most difficult and remarkable
in the annals of the conquest. He had to contend against relentless
savages, dismal swamps and almost impenetrable forests, where he had to
cut his way through the tangled vines and bushes, and where it was
often impossible to make more than a league a day. His men were
decimated by disease and starvation. When he at last arrived at the
Valle de Alcazares, near the present site of Bogot&aacute;, he could
count but one hundred infantry and sixty cavalry. But with this handful
of men he had conquered the Chibcha nation, numbering, according to the
old chroniclers, one million people and having twenty thousand soldiers
in the field.</p>
<p>Scarcely, however, was his campaign against the aborigines
successfully terminated, when information was conveyed him of a new
danger in the person of a German competitor, who had just arrived from
the llanos.</p>
<p>Five years previously, Federmann, in the service of the Welsers, had
left Coro in Venezuela, with four hundred well-armed and
well-provisioned men. After wandering over trackless plains and through
dark and almost impenetrable forests, enduring frightful hardships of
all kinds, he finally got word of the Chibchas and of their treasures
of gold and precious stones. He forthwith changed his route and crossed
the Eastern Cordilleras, where the traveler Andr&eacute; assures us it
is now absolutely impossible to pass.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6477src" href="#xd21e6477" name="xd21e6477src">8</a></p>
<p>Thus, almost before Quesada was aware that Federmann was in the
country, he was constrained by policy to receive him and his one
hundred ragged and famished followers&mdash;these were all that
remained of his gallant band&mdash;as his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>guests. The Spanish
conquistador knew that the German leader would put in a claim for a
part of the territory that they had both been exploring, and which,
until then, each of them had regarded as his own by right of conquest.
He was then naturally eager to effect a settlement with his competitor
on the best terms possible, and get him out of the country with the
least possible delay. Federmann agreed to renounce all his claims in
consideration of his receiving himself the sum of ten thousand pesos,
and of having his soldiers enjoy all the rights of discoverers and
conquistadores accorded to those of Quesada.</p>
<p>Scarcely, however, had these negotiations been happily terminated,
when another and a more formidable rival appeared on the scene, on his
way from the distant South. This was Sebastian de Belalcazar,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6489src" href="#xd21e6489" name="xd21e6489src">9</a>
the famous lieutenant of Francisco Pizarro. He was then governor of
Quito and the conqueror of much of the territory now included in
Ecuador and Southern Colombia. Hearing casually of El Dorado and of the
marvelous riches this ruler was reputed to possess, the Spanish
chieftain lost no time in organizing an expedition to the country of
gold and emeralds, of fertile plains and delightful valleys. Setting
out with the assurance of an early and easy victory, and of soon
becoming the possessors of untold wealth and all the enjoyment that
wealth could command, the soldiers, in quest of El Dorado, exclaimed
with unrestrained enthusiasm:</p>
<div lang="es" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Nuestros sean su oro y sus placeres,</p>
<p class="line">Gocemos de ese campo y ese sol.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6497src" href="#xd21e6497" name=
"xd21e6497src">10</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">But anticipation is not fruition. This the Spaniards
soon learned to their sorrow. Like Quesada and Federmann and their
followers, Belalcazar and his men had to endure frightful hardships
during the long and painful march of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>many months from
Quito to the plateau of Bogot&aacute;. According to Castellanos, who
wrote while many of these adventurers were still living, and who had
received from them directly an account of their privations and
sufferings and the countless obstacles that at times rendered progress
almost impossible, their journey was made through mountains and
districts that were inaccessible and uninhabitable, through gloomy
forests and dense, tangled underbrush; through inhospitable lands and
dismal swamps, where there was neither food nor shelter for man or
beast.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6512src" href="#xd21e6512" name=
"xd21e6512src">11</a></p>
<p>This extraordinary and accidental meeting of the three
conquistadores, coming from so great distances, from three different
points of the compass, is one of the most interesting episodes in the
history of the conquest. It was a critical moment for the Europeans. If
they had failed to agree, and had turned their arms against one
another, those who would have escaped alive would have been at the
mercy of the Indians, who would at once have rallied their forces to
repel the invaders. But, fortunately, wise councils prevailed and a
clash was averted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the clergy and the religious,&rdquo; writes Acosta,
&ldquo;were going to and from the different camps endeavoring to
prevent a rupture, the three parties of Spaniards, coming from points
so distant, and now occupying the three apices of a triangle, whose
sides measured three or four leagues, presented a singular spectacle.
Those from Peru were clad in scarlet cloth and silk, and wore steel
helmets and costly plumes. Those from Santa Marta had cloaks, linens
and caps made by the Indians. Those, however, from Venezuela, like
refugees from Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s island, were covered with the
skins of bears, leopards, tigers and deer. Having journeyed more than
thirteen hundred leagues through uninhabited lands, they had
experienced the most cruel hardships. They arrived poor, naked, and
reduced to one-fourth of their original number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three chiefs,&rdquo; continues Acosta, &ldquo;were among
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>most distinguished men who ever came to America.
Belalcazar, son of a woodman of Extremadura, attained by his talents
and valor the reputation of being one of the most celebrated
conquistadores of South America and was endowed in a degree far above
the other two with political tact and observing genius. As soon as he
became aware of the agreement entered into between Quesada and
Federmann, he nobly waived his rights, and declined to accept the sum
which Quesada offered him. He stipulated only that his soldiers should
not be prevented from returning to Peru, when they might desire to do
so, or when Pizarro should demand them, and that Captain Juan Cabrera
should return to found a town in Neiva, a territory which, along with
Timana, was to be under the government of Popayan, which it was his
intention to solicit from the Emperor. In the meantime he agreed to
accompany Quesada to Spain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6523src"
href="#xd21e6523" name="xd21e6523src">12</a></p>
<p>The three went to Spain together, as had been arranged, each of them
confident of receiving from the Spanish monarch a reward commensurate
with his labors and services to the crown. Each one aspired to the
governorship of New Granada and used all his influence to secure the
coveted prize.</p>
<p>The net result of their efforts was a sad experience of the vanity
of human wishes. All were disappointed in their expectations. The
guerdon all so eagerly strove for was awarded to another, who had taken
no part in the conquest that had rendered the three aspirants to royal
favor so famous.</p>
<p>Only Belalcazar received any recognition whatever. He was made
adelantado of Popayan and the surrounding territory. As for Quesada and
Federmann, they fell into disfavor. The latter soon disappeared from
public view entirely, but long afterwards, Quesada was able to return
to the land where he had won so many laurels. And it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>fitting that, after his death, his remains
should repose in the noble cathedral that adorns the capital of which
he was the founder.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6536src" href=
"#xd21e6536" name="xd21e6536src">13</a></p>
<p>In adventure and achievement, the three conquistadores above
mentioned take rank with Cortes, Pizarro and Orellana. Given a Homer,
their wanderings and deeds would afford themes for three Odysseys of
intense and abiding interest. Given even an Ercilla, we should have a
literary monument, which, in romantic episode and dramatic effect,
would eclipse the <i>Araucana</i>, the nearest approach to an epic that
South America has yet produced.</p>
<p>The Bogot&aacute;nos have long claimed for their city the
distinction of being the Athens of South America. And considering its
past and present culture, and the attention which the arts, the
sciences and literature have always received there since the foundation
of the capital, few, I think, will be disposed to impugn the justness
of this claim.</p>
<p>Bogot&aacute;&rsquo;s first man of letters was none other than the
licentiate Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada himself&mdash;a man who could
wield the pen with as much skill as the sword. Indeed, the detailed
knowledge that we have of many features of his memorable campaigns we
owe to his fertile pen. He is really the first and, in some respects,
the most important chronicler of the events in which he took so
conspicuous a part. How unlike, in this respect, is he not, to Pizarro
and Almagro, who were unable to sign their own names?</p>
<p>Among the other early writers of New Granada was Padre Juan de
Castellanos, the poet-historiographer, who has been so frequently
quoted in the preceding chapters. The extent of his work may be gauged
by the fact that it contains one hundred and fifty thousand
hendecasyllabic verses&mdash;more than ten times as many as are in the
<i lang="it">Divina Commedia</i>&mdash;and more than are found in any
other metrical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>work, except the Hindu epic known as the
Mahabharata, which contains no fewer than one hundred and ten thousand
couplets.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in Colombia, as in Spain, Portugal
and Mexico, the nun in the cloister has found time to devote to
literature as well as to contemplation and works of charity. Among
these successful imitators of St. Theresa, whose works, both in prose
and verse, have long been the admiration of the literary world, may be
mentioned Sor Francisca Josefa de la Concepcion, of Tunga. Although she
wrote in prose, she, by her purity of language and delicacy of
sentiment, is entitled to rank with such distinguished ornaments of the
cloister as Sor Junana Ines de la Cruz, of Mexico; Sor Maria de Ceo, of
Portugal; Sor Gregoria de Santa Teresa, of Seville; and Sor Ana de San
Jeronimo, of Granada, Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6561src" href=
"#xd21e6561" name="xd21e6561src">14</a></p>
<p>The names of the poets and prose writers of Colombia, that have
achieved distinction, make a long list. Many of them enjoy an
international reputation, and their productions compare favorably with
the best efforts of the writers of the mother
country&mdash;Spain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6568src" href=
"#xd21e6568" name="xd21e6568src">15</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span></p>
<p>In science, too, Colombia counts many sons who have contributed
greatly to our knowledge of nature. It suffices to recall the names of
such savants as Francisco Antonio Zea, Francisco Jos&eacute; de Caldas
and the illustrious Mutis, whom Humboldt called &ldquo;the patriarch of
the botanists of the New World,&rdquo; and whose name Linn&aelig;eus
declared to be immortal&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="la">nomen immortale quod
nulla aetas unquam delebit</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were at one time no fewer than twenty-three colleges in New
Granada. The first of these was founded in 1554, for the education of
the Indians. The following year another one was established for the
benefit of Spanish orphans and mestizos. In one of the colleges was a
special chair for the study of the Muisca language. The Royal and
Pontifical University began its existence in 1627, thirteen years
before the foundation of Harvard College. In 1653 the Archbishop D. Fr.
Cristobal de Torres founded the celebrated College del Rosario, which,
by reason of its munificent endowment, was able to render such splendid
service to the cause of education, and was long recognized as the
leading institution of learning in New Granada.</p>
<p>Although the Viceroyalty of Santa Fe was behind Mexico<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6619src" href="#xd21e6619" name=
"xd21e6619src">16</a> and Lima in the introduction of the printing
press, it claims the honor of establishing the first astronomical
observatory in America, as Mexico was the first to have a botanical
garden, a school of mines, and a school of medicine. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>It
was also among the first, if not the very first, of the capitals of the
New World to open a public library.</p>
<p>The number of public and private libraries now existing in the city
of Bogot&aacute; contribute greatly towards justifying its claim to
being the chief centre of South American culture. Another evidence of
the intellectual atmosphere that obtains there is the number of
secondhand book stores. In browsing among these storehouses of old and
precious tomes I quite forgot, for the time being, that I was so far
from the busy world of action, and could easily fancy myself among the
book shops of Florence, Leipsic or Paris. Indeed, some of the most
prized volumes in my Latin-American library I picked up on the book
stalls of Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>Mr. R. B. Cunninghame Graham, in his preface to Sr. Triana&rsquo;s
work, <i>Down the Orinoco in a Canoe</i>, says the capital of Colombia
&ldquo;is in a way a kind of Chibcha Athens. There all men write, and
poets rave and madden through the land, and only wholesome necessary
revolutions keep their number down.&rdquo; Again, he declares:
&ldquo;Bogot&aacute; to-day is, without doubt, the greatest literary
centre south of Panama. Putting aside the flood of titubating verse
which, like a mental dysentery, afflicts all members of the
Spanish-speaking race, in Bogot&aacute; more serious literary work is
done during a month than in the rest of the republics in a
year.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6631src" href="#xd21e6631"
name="xd21e6631src">17</a></p>
<p>Mr. W. L. Scruggs, sometime American minister to Bogot&aacute;,
writes in the same sense. &ldquo;Most of the educated classes,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;have, or think they have, the literary faculty. They
are particularly fond of writing what they call poetry, and of making
post-prandial speeches. The average collegian will write
poetry<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6636src" href="#xd21e6636" name=
"xd21e6636src">18</a> by the yard or speak impromptu by the hour. He
never shows the least embarrassment before an audience, and is rarely
at a loss for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span>a word. The adjectives and adverbs flow in
sluices of unbroken rhythm, and the supply of euphonious words and
hyperbolic phrases seems inexhaustible. He always gesticulates
vehemently, and somehow it seems to become him well; for no matter how
little there may be in what he says, somebody is sure to applaud and
encourage him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Colombia there seem to be as many &ldquo;doctors,&rdquo; that is,
men who have the degree of Doctor of Laws, as there are generals in
Venezuela. Most of them are politicians, or contributors to the various
newspapers of the country, or &ldquo;professors&rdquo;&mdash;there are
no pedagogues&mdash;in the numerous educational institutions of the
Republic.</p>
<p>The number of newspapers published in Bogot&aacute; is
surprising&mdash;more than there are in Boston or Philadelphia. Of
course, <span class="corr" id="xd21e6648" title=
"Source: there">their</span> circulation is extremely limited. They are
mostly partisan organs&mdash;an independent paper being
unknown&mdash;or literary journals remarkable, the majority of them,
for long poems, verbose editorials and translations of the latest
French novels.</p>
<p>On the way down from the chapel of Guadalupe, near the opening of
the gorge between the peaks of Monserrate and Guadalupe, one passes
what was once the Quinta Bolivar, a gift to the Liberator by one of his
wealthy admirers. It is now the property of a thrifty Antioquenian, who
has converted it into a tannery. As we pass along the north side of San
Carlos&rsquo; palace, which contains the office of the ministry of
foreign affairs, we observe the historic window from which, as a
memorial tablet informs us, Bolivar escaped assassination, Sept. 25th,
1828. In the centre of the principal plaza, called the Plaza Bolivar,
is a bronze statue of the Liberator by Tenerani, a pupil of Canova.</p>
<p>Everywhere in Colombia, as in Venezuela, we are reminded of Bolivar
and find monuments to his memory. In Ciudad Bolivar and in Valencia and
elsewhere there are statues of him. In Caracas there are several, among
them a large equestrian statue which is a replica of one in Lima.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the people, in their desire to honor their hero, have not been
satisfied with statues alone. Coins bear his name and image, towns and
states are named after him. More than this, his name has been given to
one of the South American republics&mdash;Bolivia&mdash;a republic,
formerly a part of Peru&mdash;Upper Peru&mdash;which owes its very
existence to him.</p>
<p>But who was Simon Bolivar, one will ask, and what has he done to
achieve such distinction and to command recognition in such diverse
ways and in regions so widely separated?</p>
<p>His admirers say that he was the Washington of South
America&mdash;the one who secured the independence of the Spanish
colonies, after three centuries of misrule and oppression. According to
them, he was one of the world&rsquo;s greatest geniuses in military
science, a genius in state-craft, a genius in everything required to
make a great and successful leader of men.</p>
<p>Sr. Miguel Tejera does not hesitate to characterize him as one who
was &ldquo;Bold and fortunate as Alexander, a patriot like Hannibal,
brave and clement like C&aelig;sar, a great captain and a profound
statesman like Napoleon, honorable as Washington, a sublime poet and a
versatile orator, such was Bolivar, who united in his own mind all the
vast multiplicity of the elements of genius. His glory will shine in
the heaven of history, not as a meteor that passes, and is lost in the
bosom of space, but as a heavenly body, whose radiance is
ever-increasing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6664src" href=
"#xd21e6664" name="xd21e6664src">19</a></p>
<p>Even more extravagant are the claims made for his hero by Don Felipe
Larazabel in his bulky two-tome <i lang="es">Vida de Bolivar</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A noble and sublime spirit, humane, just, liberal, Bolivar
was one of the most gifted men the world has ever known; so perfect and
unique that in goodness he was like Titus, in his fortune and
achievements like Trapan, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href=
"#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>urbanity like Marcus Aurelius, in
valor like C&aelig;sar, in learning and eloquence like Augustus....</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a poet like Homer, a legislator like Plato, a soldier
like Bonaparte.... He taught Soublett and Heres diplomacy, Santander
administration, Gual politics, Marshal Sucre military art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Charlemagne, but in a higher degree, he possessed the
art of doing great things with ease and difficult things with
promptness. Whoever conceived plans so vast? Whoever carried them to a
more successful issue? A quick and unerring glance; a rapid intuition
of things and times; a prodigious spontaneity in improvising gigantic
plans; the science of war reduced to the calculation of minutes, an
extraordinary vigor of conception, and a creative spirit, fertile and
inexhaustible, ... such was Bolivar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Deus ille fuit, Deus, inclyte Memmi.&rsquo; He was a
god, illustrious Memmius, he was a god.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6685src" href="#xd21e6685" name="xd21e6685src">20</a></p>
<p>Col. G. Hippisley, who served under Bolivar in the War of
Independence, does not give such a flattering estimate of the
Liberator. &ldquo;Bolivar,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;would willingly ape
the great man. He aspires to be a second Bonaparte in South America,
without possessing a single talent for the duties of the field or the
cabinet.... He has neither talents nor abilities for a general, and
especially for a commander-in-chief.... Tactics, movements and
man&oelig;uvre are as unknown to him as to the lowest of his troops.
All idea of regularity, system or the common routine of an army, or
even a regiment, he is totally unacquainted with. Hence arise all the
disasters he meets, the defeats he suffers and his constant obligations
to retreat whenever opposed to the foe. The victory, which he gains
to-day, however dearly purchased ... is lost to-morrow by some failure
or palpable neglect on his part. Thus it is that Paez was heard to tell
Bolivar, after the action at Villa del Cura, that he would move off
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>his own troops, and act no more with him in
command; adding, &lsquo;I have never lost a battle wherein I acted by
myself, or in a separate command; and I have always been defeated when
acting in connection with you or under your
orders.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6692src" href=
"#xd21e6692" name="xd21e6692src">21</a></p>
<p>Gen. Holstein, who was the Liberator&rsquo;s chief-of-staff and who
was, therefore, in a position to have intimate knowledge of the man, is
even more pronounced in his strictures on the character and capacity of
the commander-in-chief of the patriot forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dominant traits in the character of General Bolivar are
ambition, vanity, thirst for absolute, undivided power and profound
dissimulation.... Many of his generals have done far more than he has
to free the country from the Spaniards.... The brightest deeds of all
these generals were performed in the absence of Bolivar. Abroad they
were attributed to his military skill and heroism, while, in fact, he
was a fugitive a thousand miles from the scenes of their bravery, and
never dreaming of their success.... General Bolivar, moreover, has
never made a charge of cavalry nor with the bayonet; on the contrary,
he has ever been careful to keep himself out of danger.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6701src" href="#xd21e6701" name=

<p>Elsewhere in his work, Holstein claims to &ldquo;prove that Bolivar,
the Republic of Colombia and its chieftains, are indebted to strangers
and their powerful support for their existence, if not as a free, at
least as an independent people.&rdquo; There were, according to some
estimates, fully ten thousand European soldiers in the republican army,
and among the officers were Englishmen, Germans, Irishmen, Poles and
Frenchmen. It was, according to Holstein, the Irish legion that gained
the great battle of Carabobo, which secured the independence of
Venezuela.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6708src" href="#xd21e6708" name=
"xd21e6708src">23</a> It was the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307"
href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>British legion, declares the
same writer, that won the decisive victory of Boyac&aacute;, which
broke the power of the Spaniards in New Granada. Sucre, the victorious
general in the battle of Pichincha, which liberated Ecuador, was also
the victor in the battles of Junin and Ayacucho&mdash;the Waterloo of
colonial rule in South America&mdash;which gave freedom to Peru.
Bolivar had the honor of gaining both victories, although he was ill
during the battle of Ayacucho, and a hundred miles from the field of
action during the struggle on the plateau of Junin.</p>
<p>In view of all this, Holstein does not hesitate to declare that
Bolivar rules &ldquo;with more power and absoluteness than does the
autocrat of Russia or the Sultan of Constantinople,&rdquo; and that,
compared with George Washington, Simon Bolivar was but a Liliputian.
Sr. Riva Aguero, the first president of Peru, goes farther and assures
us that the terrible characterization, given by Apollocorus, of Philip
of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, is but a true portrait of
the Liberator Bolivar.</p>
<p>These estimates of Bolivar, so different from those of Tejera and
Larrazabel and many of Bolivar&rsquo;s other biographers&mdash;remind
one of what Montesquieu says about the contradictory accounts which
partisan writers have given us regarding certain potentates of
antiquity. As instances he cites Alexander, who is described as the
veriest poltroon by Herodian, and extolled as a paragon of valor by
Lampridius; and Gratian, who by his admirers is lauded to the skies and
by Philostorgus compared to Nero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, how is it possible, the question naturally arises, that
General Bolivar should have liberated his country, and preserved to
himself the supreme power, without superior talent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If by liberating his country,&rdquo; replies Gen. Holstein,
in answer to his own question, &ldquo;it be meant that he has given his
country a free government, I answer that he has not done so. If it be
meant that he has driven out the Spaniards, I answer that he has done
little towards this; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span>far less certainly than the meanest of his
subordinate chieftains. To the question, How can he have retained his
power without superior talent? I answer, in the first place, that the
<i>reputation</i> of superior talent goes a great way.... The stupid
management of the Spanish authorities has facilitated all the
operations of the patriots. The grievous faults of Bolivar and some of
his generals have been exceeded by those of his adversaries. It is not
strange, therefore, that Bolivar should have been able to do all he has
done with very limited talents.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6729src" href="#xd21e6729" name="xd21e6729src">24</a></p>
<p>Such a marked divergence of views respecting the character of
Bolivar and the position he should occupy among the great chieftains of
history admits of an explanation, but such an explanation would of
itself require a volume. It is safe to say, however, that no reliable
biography of the Liberator has yet appeared, and that, when it does
appear, it is most likely that Bolivar will occupy a position much
below that claimed for him by some of his over-enthusiastic eulogists
and above that assigned to him by those who have manifested less
admiration for his policy and achievements.</p>
<p>To write a definitive biography of Bolivar will not be an easy task.
It will require a man of broad sympathies; one entirely free from all
national antipathy and religious bias; one with a judicial mind, who
can sift and weigh evidence without prejudice, and render a verdict
strictly in accordance with the facts in the case. Most, if not all,
who have hitherto written about Bolivar, have exhibited a partisan
spirit and allowed themselves to be swayed by political and other
considerations, which have so greatly detracted from the value of their
work that it cannot be accepted as authentic history.</p>
<p>To do full justice to the subject in all its bearings will require
impartial judgment, ripe and varied scholarship, and above all, a keen
and comprehensive historic sense. The writer will have to discuss the
relation of Spain to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309"
name="pb309">309</a>]</span>her colonies, and consider various social,
political, racial, economical and religious questions that are as
difficult as they are complicated and conflicting. He must have an
intimate and accurate knowledge of the character and aspirations of the
different peoples with whom Bolivar and his lieutenants had to deal. He
must be familiar with the history and traditions of the various South
American presidencies and viceroyalties and captaincies-general, and
take note of the passions and prejudices and jealousies that have been
the cause of so many sanguinary revolutions and have contributed so
much to retard intellectual progress and material advancement. Only
when such an one appears, and completes the colossal task, shall we
have a definitive life of Simon Bolivar, and an authentic record of the
War of Independence.</p>
<p>Before closing this chapter some reference seems necessary to what
cannot escape even the most casual student of South American history,
but what, to the observant traveler, seems to be a matter of special
moment. I refer to Bolivar&rsquo;s policy of dividing and weakening
Peru, and to his uniting under one flag the three northern countries of
the continent. The separation of Upper Peru&mdash;Bolivia&mdash;from
Lower Peru seems, in the light of events since the change, to have been
a fatal mistake and detrimental to the best interests of Bolivia as
well as to those of Peru.</p>
<p>I think, however, he exhibited unusual wisdom and foresight in
combining in one republic&mdash;Gran Colombia&mdash;the provinces of
Quito, New Granada and Venezuela. I know Gen. Mitre has denounced the
idea as an absurdity&mdash;<i lang="es">como un
absurdo</i>&mdash;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6748src" href=
"#xd21e6748" name="xd21e6748src">25</a> but, if this distinguished
writer had had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>an opportunity to study actual conditions, as
they present themselves to the traveler to-day, and to consult the
wishes and welfare of the large mass of the people at present dwelling
within the confines of Greater Colombia, I think he would have been
disposed to accept Bolivar&rsquo;s plan for a great nation, extending
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as the best for all concerned.</p>
<p>Had the destiny of Colombia, after the union, been entrusted to the
direction of wise and unselfish patriots, as was the infant Republic of
the United States of North America, one may well believe that the
history of this part of South America, during the last three-quarters
of a century, would have been quite different from what it has been,
and that it would have been spared those countless internecine wars
that have deluged the country in blood and rendered civilization, in
its higher sense, impossible.</p>
<p>The geographical features of the country, and the diverse interests
of its different sections, were, pace Mitre, no more opposed to the
formation of a great and stable republic on the Caribbean than they
were in that vast commonwealth to the north of the Gulf of Mexico,
where the Stars and Stripes have so long been the symbol of peace,
prosperity and national greatness. The people in the southern
continent, were not, it is true, so well prepared for a democratic form
of government as were their brethren in the north, but if, instead of
being cursed with selfish and destructive militarism, they could have
enjoyed the blessings of competent and far-seeing <span class="corr"
id="xd21e6762" title="Source: statemanship">statesmanship</span>, it is
safe to affirm that the Great Colombia, as Bolivar conceived it, would,
ere this, have developed into a flourishing and powerful
republic&mdash;worthy of taking a place among the great nations of the
world.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6765src" href="#xd21e6765" name=
"xd21e6765src">26</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href=
"#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span></p>
<p>But, sad to relate, Bolivar&rsquo;s creation was short-lived. After
a precarious existence of only eleven years, disintegration took place,
and the Liberator, fallen into disfavor and condemned to exile, was
forced to be a witness of the collapse of the structure that had cost
him so much labor, and which he had fondly hoped would be his greatest
and most enduring monument.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death at the hacienda of San Pedro, near Santa
Marta, where he perished alone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maligned and doubted and denied, a broken-hearted man,&rdquo;
he wrote to General Flores, of Ecuador, a letter in which occur the
following remarkable statements:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in power&mdash;<i>yo he mandado</i>&mdash;for
nearly twenty years, from which I have gathered only a few definite
results:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. America for us is ungovernable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. He who dedicates his services to a revolution plows the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3. The only thing that can be done in America is to
emigrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4. This country will inevitably fall into the hands of the
unbridled rabble, and little by little become a prey to petty tyrants
of all colors and races.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5. Devoured as we shall be by all possible crimes and ruined
by our own ferociousness, Europeans will not deem it worth while to
conquer us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6. If it were possible for any part of the world to return
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>to a state of primitive chaos, that would be the
last stage of Spanish America.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6800src" href="#xd21e6800" name="xd21e6800src">27</a></p>
<p>Was the Liberator gifted with a seer&rsquo;s vision when he penned
these prophetic words? It would seem so, for even if he had open before
him the scroll in which has been recorded the chief events of the
history of South America during the past three-quarters of a century,
he could scarcely have spoken with greater truth and precision. Certain
it is, as Mitre well observes, that none of his designs or ideals have
survived him. His political work died with him and all his fond dreams
of a vast Andean Empire vanished like mist before the rising sun.</p>
<p>This is not the place to account for the turmoil and anarchy which
have so long devastated one of the most fertile quarters of the globe.
Considering its immense natural resources and its many advantages of
climate and geographical position, it should be one of the most
prosperous regions of the earth, and its inhabitants among the happiest
and most advanced in culture and the arts of peace. Let it suffice to
reproduce the following paragraph from the work, already cited, of Sr.
Perez Triana:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the topsy-turviness of things Spanish and
Spanish-American, the story is told that Santiago, the patron saint of
Spain, being admitted into the presence of God, asked and obtained for
the land of Spain and for its people all sorts of blessings; marvelous
fertility for the soil, natural wealth of all kinds in the mountains
and the forests, abundance of fish in the rivers and of birds in the
air; courage, sobriety, and all the manly virtues for men; beauty,
grace and loveliness for the women. All this was granted, but on the
point of leaving, the saint, it is said, asked from God that he would
also grant Spain a good government. The request was denied, as then, it
is said, the Lord remarked, the angels would abandon heaven and flock
to Spain. The story has lost none of its point.&rdquo; <span class=

&ldquo;In the remotest times,&rdquo; writes Humboldt, following Quesada
and Piedrahita, &ldquo;before the moon accompanied the earth, according
to the mythology of the Muysca or Mozca Indians, the inhabitants of the
plain of Bogat&aacute; lived like barbarians, naked, without
agriculture, without any form of laws or worship. Suddenly there
appeared among them an old man, who came from the plains situate on the
east of the Cordillera of Chingasa; and who appeared to be of a race
unlike that of the natives, having a long and bushy beard. He was known
by three distinct appellations, Bochica, Nemquetheba, and Zuhe. This
old man, like Manco-Capac, instructed men how to clothe themselves,
build huts, till the ground, and form themselves into communities. He
brought with him a woman, to whom also tradition gives three names,
Chia, Yubecayguaya, and Huythaca. This woman, extremely beautiful, and
no less malignant, thwarted every enterprise of her husband for the
happiness of mankind. By her skill in magic, she swelled the river of
Funza, and inundated the valley of Bogat&aacute;. The greater part of
the inhabitants perished in this deluge; a few only found refuge on the
summits of the neighbouring mountains. The old man, in anger drove the
beautiful Huythaca far from the Earth, and she became the Moon, which
began from that epoch to enlighten our planet during the night.
Bochica, moved with compassion for those who were dispersed over the
mountains, broke with his powerful arm the rocks that enclosed the
valley, on the side of Canoas and Tequendama. By this outlet he drained
the waters of the lake of Bogot&aacute;; he built towns, introduced the
worship of the Sun, named two chiefs, between whom he divided the civil
and ecclesiastical authority, and then withdrew himself, under the name
of Idacanzas, into the holy valley of Iraca, near Tunja, where he lived
in the exercise of the most austere penitence for the space of two
thousand years.&rdquo;&mdash;<i lang="fr">Vues de Cordill&egrave;res et

par Al. de Humboldt, Paris, 1810. Compare Piedrahita&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">Historia General de las Conquistas del Nuevo Reino de Granada</i>,
Cap. III, Bogot&aacute;, 1881. Piedrahita, following other authors, was
of the opinion that Bochica was no other than the Apostle Bartholomew,
who, according to a widespread legend, preached the gospel in this part
of the world.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

&ldquo;Why do you plant these eucalyptus trees around your
houses?&rdquo; I asked of a peon one day. &ldquo;<i lang="es">Para
evitar la fiebre, Sumerced</i>,&rdquo; to prevent fever, your honor.
The &ldquo;Sumerced,&rdquo; in this reply, is only one of many
indications of deference on the part of the common people in their
intercourse with strangers, or with those whom they regard as their
superiors. It is an echo of the courtly language employed in the days
of the viceroyalty.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

height of the falls, according to Humboldt&rsquo;s measurements, is one
hundred and seventy metres. Before his visit they were supposed to be
much higher. Piedrahita calls them one of the wonders of the world and
declares that their height is half a league. Around the top of the
falls are seen oak, elm and cinchona trees; at the bottom are found
palms, bananas and sugar-cane. Colombans always refer to these facts
when they wish to impress the stranger with the extraordinary height of
Tequendama, as compared with that of other great falls. By a single
plunge, they proudly tell us, its waters pass from <i>tierra fria</i>

peculiar phenomenon, which has been frequently commented on, is that
the early prose writers of Latin America exhibited more true poetic
feeling and enthusiasm in their productions than did those who
expressed themselves in verse. <i>La Araucana</i>, the so-called epic
poem of Ercilla, pronounced an Iliad by Voltaire and considered by
Sismondi a mere newspaper in rhyme, is a case in point. Nowhere, in
this long work of forty-two thousand verses, &ldquo;has the aspect of
volcanoes covered with eternal snow, of torrid sylvan valleys, and of
arms of the sea extending far into the land, been productive of any
descriptions that may be regarded as graphical.&rdquo; It exhibits, it
is true, a certain animation in describing the heroic struggle of the
brave Araucanians for their homes and liberty, but, aside from this,
the higher elements of poetry&mdash;especially of epic poetry&mdash;are
entirely lacking.</p>
<p class="footnote">The same observation can be made with still greater
truth of the <i>Arauco Domado</i>, of Padre O&ntilde;a; of the
<i>Argentina</i>, of Barco Centenera; the <i>Cort&eacute;s
Valeroso</i>, and the <i>Mejicana</i>, of Laso de la Vega; and the
oft-quoted <i>Elegias de Varones Ilustres de Indias</i>, of Juan de
Castellanos. All of these, with the exception of the last-mentioned
work, have long since been buried in almost complete oblivion. The
influence of the Italian school is everywhere manifest in these
productions&mdash;an influence which, while it may have contributed to
purity, correctness and elegance of expression, was quite destructive
of the vigor, freshness and originality so characteristic of the great
masters of Spanish verse. Compare Humboldt&rsquo;s <i>Cosmos</i>, Vol.
II, Part I; and <i lang="es">Historias Primitivas de Indias</i>, por

&ldquo;Colombia had been an efficient war machine in the hands of
Bolivar by which the independence of South America was secured, but was
an anachronism as a nation. The interests of the different sections
were antagonistic, and the military organization given to the country
only strengthened the germs of disorder. Venezuela and New Granada were
geographically marked out as independent nations. Quito, from
historical antecedents, aspired to autonomy. Had Bolivar abstained from
his dreams of conquest, and devoted his energies to the consolidation
of his own country, he might, perhaps, have organized it into one
nation under a federal form of government, but that was not suited to
his genius. When his own bayonets turned against him, he went so far as
to despair of the republican system altogether and sought the
protection of a foreign king for the last fragment of his shattered
monocracy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>History of San Martin</i>, p. 467, by

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MUISCA TRAIL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our sojourn in Bogot&aacute; was much briefer than we
could have wished it to be. Its intellectual atmosphere impressed us
deeply, and the culture and refinement of its people charmed us beyond
expression. During our journey, we had visited many places in which we
would have desired to tarry longer, had it been possible, but so far no
place had so completely captivated us as Colombia&rsquo;s famous
metropolis&mdash;no place from which we were so loath to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;that Colombia and
Colombians are not better known in our own country! It would be better
for them and better for us.&rdquo; With special truth can one reiterate
of the inhabitants of this little-known republic what Senator Root has
said of the people of South America in general:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-thirds of the suspicion, the dislike, the distrust, with
which our country was regarded by the people of South America, was the
result of the arrogant and contemptuous bearing of Americans, of people
of the United States, for those gentle, polite, sensitive, imaginative,
delightful people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senator, as President Roosevelt&rsquo;s representative, did
much, during his visit to our sister continent, to remove
misunderstandings and establish more cordial relations between the
United States and Latin America. And the Bureau of American Republics
is contributing much towards completing and extending his work. It is,
therefore, to be hoped, that soon &ldquo;the suspicion, the dislike,
the distrust&rdquo; will be eliminated forever and succeeded by an era
of mutual respect and indissoluble friendship. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>Our luggage&mdash;small in amount, be it said&mdash;was conveyed
from our hotel to the depot, a few blocks distant, by a good-natured
Chibcha Indian. He asked for his service the sum of forty dollars,
which, to his great delight, was paid promptly and without question.
&ldquo;<i lang="es">Muchisimas gracias, mi amo. Que Vd vaya
bien!</i>&rdquo; Many thanks, my master. Farewell! were his parting
words, as he passed out of the station with his hat in his hand and a
smile lighting up his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty dollars for carrying a little luggage a few squares!
Why, that,&rdquo; one would say, &ldquo;was down-right robbery.&rdquo;
Not at all, when you are accustomed to paying such prices, and we had
become quite accustomed to them, ever since we had entered Colombian
territory. As a matter of fact, we found the peon&rsquo;s bill very
moderate.</p>
<p>In the beginning, however, it must be confessed that we were
surprised at some of the bills presented us for payment. The first one
was for the washing of some linen in a town on the Meta. The work was
done by an Indian woman, for which a charge was made of two hundred and
forty-five dollars. This bill, large as it was, did not frighten us as
much as one that Mark Twain tells of in his <i>Innocents Abroad</i>,
when during his visit to the Azores, one of his traveling companions
was charged some thousands of milreis for a modest repast. We should
have paid it without comment, but found that the articles in question
had been washed only and not ironed. When we remarked upon this
apparent forgetfulness or neglect, the tawny laundress informed us that
it was not the custom there for the same person to do both washing and
ironing, and referred us to a neighbor of hers as one quite competent
to complete the work she had begun. Unfortunately, as it had been
raining continuously for several days, and our laundress had no way of
drying the things she had washed, except in the sun&mdash;which had
obstinately refused to appear&mdash;and as we were obliged to take our
departure <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>without delay, the wearing apparel aforesaid was
neither ironed nor dried.</p>
<p>But the washer-woman&rsquo;s bill, which seems exorbitant, requires
an explanation. It was all a mere matter of the rate of exchange,
which, in Colombia, during the time of our visit, was ten thousand.
That means that the <i>peso</i>&mdash;dollar&mdash;had a value of just
one <i>centavo</i>&mdash;one cent. Some years ago the rate of exchange
was much higher. Now, however, there is a well-founded hope, that the
financial condition of the country will soon be on a more satisfactory
basis, and that before many years elapse, it can be put on a gold
basis. The present legal tender of the country is paper currency and
gold coin. Outside of the large cities one never sees anything but
paper money. I have known the peons in several cases to refuse coin
because they thought it was counterfeit&mdash;so long is it since gold
coin has been in circulation.</p>
<p>The present financial condition of the republic is a striking
commentary on the havoc wrought by the numerous revolutions that have
devastated the country and ruined its credit. One of the most difficult
of the many difficult tasks that confront the administration is that of
restoring the nation&rsquo;s credit, and of getting the rate of
exchange back to par. It is, however, making a noble effort, and all
well-wishers of Colombia trust its endeavors will be crowned with
success.</p>
<p>As one may imagine, it is necessary for the traveler to carry with
him quite a bulky package of bills in order to live in even the most
modest fashion. A mule or a cart was not, however, required to
transport our funds, as Hazard, in his work on Haiti, says was
indispensable in that ill-fated land, where a hundred dollars in gold
was exchanged for several sacks of bills&mdash;huge bags&mdash;not
unlike bundles of rags or waste paper.</p>
<p>To us it was always interesting to hear the peons talk of their
fortune of hundreds or thousands of dollars. It seemed to give the poor
fellows special satisfaction to deal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb316" href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>in large figures and
to speak of large sums, as if they were all rising millionaires. The
monetary crisis had this redeeming feature, if no other, that it
afforded the beggar in the street the pleasure of seeing dollars in his
alms where, before the revolution, he would have found only so many
cents. The sturdy market women we saw on the way from Caqueza to
Bogot&aacute; talked in a most happy way of their prospects of
realizing forty dollars a piece for their chickens and fifteen dollars
a dozen for their eggs, while their husbands were rejoicing in the
thought that they would receive a thousand dollars for a heifer and two
thousand or more for a milch-cow. They never used the words
&ldquo;cents&rdquo;; it was always
&ldquo;<i>pesos</i>&rdquo;&mdash;dollars. Happy people, who find such
delight in names and appearances!</p>
<p>There are but few railroads in Colombia, and their total mileage at
the time of our visit was less than five hundred miles. Many roads are
projected and have been for decades past, but the numerous revolutions
have prevented their construction. The one from Bogot&aacute; to
Facatativ&aacute;, our first objective point on the way to the
Magdalena, is only twenty-five miles in length. There is, however, a
well-grounded hope that this can at an early day be connected with the
line that is building from Girardot.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6864src" href="#xd21e6864" name="xd21e6864src">1</a> When this
shall have been accomplished it will be possible to reach Bogot&aacute;
without the long overland ride on horse- or mule-back that has been
necessary since the time of Quesada.</p>
<p>But far from regretting the lack of a through train to the
Magdalena, we were rather glad that we were obliged to have recourse to
a less expeditious mode of locomotion. It required more time, it is
true, to make the trip, and was more fatiguing, but it gave us an
opportunity of seeing the country to greater advantage and of getting
better acquainted with its people. Indeed, the journey down the
Cordillera from Bogot&aacute; to Honda was but the proper complement of
that from the llanos up to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>Sabana that lies at the foot
of the nation&rsquo;s capital. It gave us an opportunity of comparing
conditions on the eastern slope of the Oriental Andes with those
prevailing on the western, and we have always considered ourselves
fortunate in having been able to explore from the saddle the
interesting country that lies between the Meta and the Magdalena. As I
now think, it was, in many respects, the most delightful and
instructive part of our wanderings in South America.</p>
<p>The track and rolling-stock of the Sabana railway are, as might be
expected, of the most primitive kind. The roadbed has received little
attention, and the cars and engine are scarcely fit for service. But
all this can be condoned when one is familiar with the untoward
conditions that, for so many years, have militated against improvements
of all kinds. The transportation of the rails, cars and locomotives
from Cambao, on the Magdalena, to the plateau, when the cart road
between the two points was little better than a bridle-path, was in
itself a Herculean task, and as we journeyed to Honda, it never ceased
to excite our wonder. Great improvements, however, are promised as soon
as connection shall be made with the branch, now approaching
completion, from Girardot. Then the transportation of heavy freight
will be a trifling task in comparison with what it has been
hitherto.</p>
<p>The Sabana of Bogot&aacute; resembles somewhat the plain of Caracas
except that it is far more extensive than the Venezuelan plateau. Both
have been regarded as the beds of lakes that have long since
disappeared. Whatever may be said about the existence of a lake in the
vale of Caracas, it seems now quite certain that there never was any
great body of water, such as has so long been imagined, occupying the
region now known as the Sabana de Bogot&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6875src" href="#xd21e6875" name="xd21e6875src">2</a> Recent
investigations appear to have decided this much-debated question
against Humboldt and those who accepted his views regarding this
matter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span></p>
<p>We were much interested in the haciendas through which the train
passed, as well as in the homes of their owners and in the picturesque
villages along the road. There were broad acres devoted to the
cultivation of wheat, barley, maize and potatoes, and extensive
pastures, over which roamed large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle.
These cattle, so we fancied, were the lineal descendants of those
brought to Espa&ntilde;ola by Columbus at the time of his second
voyage. And the swine we saw&mdash;there could be little doubt about
it&mdash;could claim, as their ancestors, those which Belalcazar had
brought with him from Quito, as the hens, that cackled and clucked as
we sped by, were the offspring of those carefully guarded by Federmann
during his famous expedition from Coro to Santa Fe de
Bogot&aacute;.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6884src" href="#xd21e6884"
name="xd21e6884src">3</a></p>
<p>Aside from the Humboldt oak, with its majestic crown of ever-green
foliage, and the ubiquitous Eucalyptus, there are no trees of any
magnitude in the Sabana. Its flora, however, is particularly rich in
shrubs and plants. Among them were the beautiful passion flower,
<i>Passiflora Antioquensis</i>, blossoming the year round, and a
peculiar species of blackberry&mdash;<i>Rubus Bogotensis</i>&mdash;ever
clothed with a vari-colored mantle of snow-white bloom and ripening
fruit, realizing Shelley&rsquo;s idea of the millennium, where</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fruits are ever ripe, and flowers ever
fair.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>The meadows are carpeted with various species of clover and
succulent grasses, and, along the hedges and walls, one finds an
endless variety of fuchsias, verbenas, mallows, asters, buttercups,
lupines, lilies, lobelias, irises, morning-glories and passion flowers.
The last two plants and certain varieties of roses are great favorites
in the garden and around the house, as are also violets, pinks,
jasmines and heliotropes. We observed several habitations, some of them
the humble cots of poor Chibchas, that were almost concealed in
magnificent bowers of climbing clematis, passion flowers and
morning-glories.</p>
<p>On the eastern slope of Suma Paz, we frequently had occasion to
admire the wealth and brilliancy of bloom around some of the homes
which we passed, or when we enjoyed the hospitality of their courteous
inmates, but nowhere did we see more beautiful floral exhibits than
greeted us on the Sabana de Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>Much, however, as we were interested in the fauna and flora of this
region, and the people who now inhabit it, we found our minds
constantly reverting to pre-Colombian times, and picturing to ourselves
the condition of this plain and its inhabitants at the period of the
arrival of the conquistadores.</p>
<p>When Quesada and his intrepid followers reached this beautiful
plateau, they found it inhabited by a tribe of Indians to whom they
gave the name Muiscas, because they frequently heard them pronounce
this word, or Moscas, a Spanish word, similar in sound, signifying
flies, because they said these Indians were as numerous as
flies.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6933src" href="#xd21e6933" name=
"xd21e6933src">4</a></p>
<p>They occupied the tablelands in the central part of New Granada. The
territory under the jurisdiction of their zipas&mdash;chiefs&mdash;was
elliptical in form and equaled in area <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>the kingdom of the
Netherlands. They numbered about one million inhabitants, and,
according to the early chroniclers, they counted no fewer than a
hundred and thirty thousand warriors. The number of fighting men was
doubtless far below this figure. It seems certain, however, that at the
date of the arrival of the Spaniards they were in the apogee of their
power, and were making progress towards a condition of culture
approaching that of the Aztecs and Incas.</p>
<p>The dominions of the last zipas of Bacat&aacute; extended from
Simijaca to Pasca and from Zipacon to the llanos. Although united by
ties of language and beliefs, customs and laws, similar in character
and revealing a common origin, they formed an aggregation of small
states, generally independent, rather than a compact and well-organized
commonwealth.</p>
<p>The Chibchas, or Muiscas, were pre&euml;minently an agricultural
people. They had no domestic animals, except the dog&mdash;not even the
llama. Their chief articles of food were maize, potatoes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6950src" href="#xd21e6950" name="xd21e6950src">5</a>
and quinoa, which the natives of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>Colombia have long since
discarded for rice. Besides these staples they had many other
vegetables peculiar to the country and a great variety of luscious and
wholesome fruits. They also had game in abundance.</p>
<p>They cultivated cotton, from which they made their clothing, the
material of which often exhibited various colored designs. In this
respect they were far in advance of the surrounding tribes, who had no
more to cover them than have the wildest children of the tropical
forest to-day.</p>
<p>Their houses were of wood, with thatched roofs not unlike many of
those we saw along our route from the llanos to the Magdalena valley.
When the Spaniards arrived they had just begun to use stone in the
erection of a few of their buildings, presumably temples, which
apparently were never completed.</p>
<p>As might be surmised, their commerce was limited. They bartered to
some extent with the neighboring tribes, especially those west of the
Magdalena. From these they obtained gold in exchange for salt, emeralds
and textile fabrics. With the Chimus of Peru, they were the first to
use gold as a medium of exchange. Their currency consisted not of
stamped coins, but of disks of the precious metal without any kind of
marking. They had a limited intercourse with the people of Quito and
had some slight knowledge of the great Inca kingdom farther south.</p>
<p>Regarding the culture of the Chibchas, we can say what the Marquis
de Nadaillac says of the people in general&mdash;&ldquo;We know very
little.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6982src" href="#xd21e6982"
name="xd21e6982src">6</a> But we know enough to be warranted in
affirming that many erroneous notions have long prevailed concerning
them, and that the claims that have been made for them as a civilized
people have been greatly exaggerated.</p>
<p>According to Duquesne&mdash;to whose fanciful theories the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>great Humboldt unfortunately gave his
support&mdash;and to the school that for a century made
Duquesne&rsquo;s views their own, the Chibchas were acquainted with the
use of the quipus, and had a system of numbers and hieroglyphics and a
complicated calendar. Their priests were represented as the
depositaries of astrological and chronological science, and as experts
in astronomical and meteorological observations. The people were lauded
for their advanced knowledge of architecture and praised for their
courts of justice. In the temple of Sogamuxi, they would have us
believe, were preserved the national annals and the chronicles of their
civilization. Their general material progress and intellectual status
was commented on as something quite comparable with the best that
obtained in Mexico or Cuzco.</p>
<p>We have but two sources of information respecting the much-debated
question of Chibcha culture. These are a comparative study of the early
chronicles&mdash;no one or two of them will suffice&mdash;and an
examination of the few stone monuments the Chibchas have left us,
together with their pictographs, ceramic ware and objects of gold and
copper found in their places of sepulture. The chronicles that we must
rely on are those left us by Quesada, Castellanos, Padre Simon and
Piedrahita, all of which have already been quoted, together with those
left us by Padre Bernardo Lugo, Juan Rodriguez Fresle, a son of one of
the conquistadores, and Fray Alonso de Zamora, of Bogot&aacute;.</p>
<p>As a result of a critical study of these chronicles and monuments,
the distinguished Colombian writer, Don Vicente Restrepo, has
demonstrated that most of the claims that have been made for Chibcha
culture are utterly devoid of foundation in fact. His conclusions,
which can be given in a few words, are:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chibchas had no stone buildings and their knowledge of
architecture was therefore limited to the erection of the simplest
structures of wood. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;They had no quipus, like that of the Incas, no alphabet, and
no writing of any kind, either figurative, symbolic or ideographic.
Neither had they any chronology or archives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The petroglyphs and pictographs found in limited<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7003src" href="#xd21e7003" name="xd21e7003src">7</a>
numbers in various parts of the country, far from recording the
migrations and hunts of the aborigines and the cataclysms which they
are supposed to have witnessed, are nothing more than rude geometrical
designs and fantastic figures which are repeated in the most confused
manner, according to the infantile caprice of the one who carved or
painted them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concluding his discussion of these meaningless figures, which
certain writers have so long insisted were true hieroglyphics, awaiting
some Champollion or Rawlinson to decipher, Sr. Restrepo does not
hesitate to assert that the rude &ldquo;attempts at drawing these
ill-formed figures of animals, and these pothooks, similar to those
traced by an inexperienced child, can reveal nothing to historic
science. They never exhibit that order and sequence which are the
certain index of genuine writing. They never reproduce even the
simplest scenes of Indian life, such for example as a religious
ceremony, the chase, or warriors fighting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mute by reason of their origin, and condemned to eternal
silence by the unconscious hand that traced them, the magic wand of
science will never be able to make them speak.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7013src" href="#xd21e7013" name="xd21e7013src">8</a></p>
<p>If we accept the classification and definitions of the various
grades of culture, as given by Morgan in his great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>work
on <i>Ancient Society</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7034src" href=
"#xd21e7034" name="xd21e7034src">9</a> as many profound thinkers do, we
shall be forced to conclude not only that the Chibchas were not
civilized, but that they had not even reached the upper status of
barbarism.</p>
<p>Civilization implies the existence of a phonetic alphabet or, at
least, of hieroglyphics akin to those of the Egyptians, and the use of
these in the production of written records. The Chibchas, as we have
seen, had neither an alphabet nor written records of any kind.</p>
<p>Neither had they any knowledge of the process of smelting iron ore.
As the use of iron is the chief characteristic of the third, or upper,
period of barbarism, the Chibchas, according to Morgan, should be
considered as representatives of the middle status of barbarism, like
the Zu&ntilde;is and the Mayas, or like the lake-dwellers of ancient
Switzerland, or the early Britons before they learned the use of iron
from their more advanced neighbors in Gaul.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7041src" href="#xd21e7041" name="xd21e7041src">10</a></p>
<p>It took us two hours to make the run from Bogot&aacute; to
Facatativ&aacute;, the western terminus of the Sabana railway. Here we
took luncheon. For a place that has so long been the centre of traffic
between the capital and the Magdalena, the town has no reason to boast
of its restaurants or hotels. They are about as poor in every way as
could well be imagined. A town in Italy or Switzerland, frequented by
so many travelers as Facatativ&aacute;, would have not one but several
hostelries where its patrons would have every convenience and comfort.
Let us hope that Colombia will soon witness an improvement in this
respect, not only in this place but all along the chief lines of
travel. It is much needed, and along no route more than that connecting
Bogot&aacute; with Honda.</p>
<p>At the time of the conquest, Facatativ&aacute; was a Muisca
stronghold, and what are said to be the ruins of an old Indian fortress
are still shown to the curious visitor. One may also see some rocks on
which are carved certain figures <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325"
href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>long supposed to be Chibcha
hieroglyphics. We have already learned what value is to be ascribed to
these and similar inscriptions in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>After luncheon we prepared to start for Chimbe, where we intended to
pass the night. We had telegraphed the day before to our <i>arriero</i>
to have in readiness the necessary saddle and sumpter mules. They were
waiting for us on our arrival and we were much gratified to find that
both animals and peons were all that could be desired. Those who have
traveled in the Andes know how important it is to have good mules and
servants, and how much it adds to the comfort and pleasure of
one&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>From the time we had left our launch on the Meta, we had been
singularly fortunate in always having good animals and honest, reliable
men to take care of them and attend to our wants on the way. To our
devoted and watchful muleteers and their assistants we owed much of the
enjoyment that was ours during our wanderings over mountain and plain,
and we shall always hold their obliging disposition and prompt service
in grateful remembrance.</p>
<p>It affords me special pleasure to render them this tribute, as they
are often, I have reason to believe, much misunderstood, especially by
people who are not familiar with their language, and frequently held
responsible for delays and contretemps of which they are in no wise
responsible. Judging by our own experience, the arieros and peons of
South America are, as a class, far better than they are usually
represented and are deserving of more recognition and better treatment
than is usually accorded them by those who require their humble but
often too poorly recompensed services.</p>
<p>The saddle generally used in the mountains closely resembles the
McClellan saddle and is called a <i>gal&aacute;pago</i>. For obvious
reasons an English hunting saddle&mdash;<i>silla</i>&mdash;could not be
used where the roads are constantly leading up and down steep
mountains&mdash;<i lang="de">bergauf</i>, <i lang="de">bergab</i>, as a
German <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>traveler phrases it&mdash;and where even on a
cavalry saddle it is at times extremely difficult for one to retain
one&rsquo;s position.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7077src" href=
"#xd21e7077" name="xd21e7077src">11</a></p>
<p>The saddle is usually covered by a <i>pellon</i> or shabrack, made
either of sheepskin, or horsehair dyed black and neatly braided at the
ends. Attached to the saddle are several bags or
pockets&mdash;<i>bolsas</i>. These are of the greatest convenience for
carrying many things necessary on long journeys. In them the natives
stow away cheese, cakes of maize, <i>papelon</i>, and the
never-forgotten supply of <i>aguardiente</i>, without which a journey
of any length is considered impossible.</p>

<p>The stirrups are curiosities. They are usually of brass or bronze in
the shape of a shoe, but frequently they are in the form of the basket
hilt of a claymore. The stirrups of one of the saddles I used were
curiously embossed, and as large as a good-sized bell. But whatever
their design, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>they are admirably adapted for service in the
mountains where the paths are so narrow that one is frequently exposed,
without such protection, to having one&rsquo;s feet crushed when his
mule approaches too near the rocky wall that flanks one side of the
road. The danger is especially great when one meets a herd of cattle or
a caravan of pack-mules. Then the rider suddenly finds his mule
crushing him against the steep rocks on one side of the path, to avoid
being thrown over a precipice which is yawning beneath him on the other
side along which the approaching animals pick their way with a skill
that is marvelous. We often had reason to be thankful that our feet
were protected by these fantastic and cumbersome
<i>estribos</i>&mdash;stirrups&mdash;as otherwise we should have
suffered serious bodily injury. Like the leather hoods of wooden
stirrups, such <i>estribos</i> also keep the feet dry.</p>
<p>The riding equipment, however, of a Colombian horseman is not
complete without huge brass or bronze
rowel-spurs&mdash;<i>espuelas</i>&mdash;and a pair of
<i>zamoros</i>&mdash;bag-trousers&mdash;often made of leather or
goatskin. They are not unlike the chaparejos<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7120src" href="#xd21e7120" name="xd21e7120src">12</a> of a New
Mexican cowboy, and serve as a protection against rain and mud, and the
thorns of the shrubs and brush along the wayside.</p>
<p>From Facatativ&aacute; to El Alto del Roble, some miles to the west,
the road slightly rises. At the latter point, nearly five hundred feet
above Bogot&aacute;, one has a glorious view of the Sabana, of the
chain of Suma Paz, and of the Central Cordillera away beyond the
Magdalena.</p>
<p>From El Roble&mdash;the oak&mdash;so named from the number of
ever-green oaks seen there, the descent towards Chimbe is marked by
quite a steep grade. A good <i>carretera</i>, or carriage road, extends
from Factativ&aacute; to Agua Larga, and this much-needed highway is to
be prolonged as far as the Magdalena. The present plan is to construct
the road in such wise that traction cars can be used on it for the
transportation of both freight and passengers, and at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>time
of our passage the road, under the direction of English engineers, was
being pushed forward towards completion with a display of energy that
augured well for ultimate success.</p>
<p>Only a few minutes after we began our descent on the western
declivity of El Roble we observed a change in the temperature. We were
passing from the <i>tierra fr&iacute;a</i> to the <i>tierra
templada</i>, and a thermometer was scarcely necessary to indicate our
rate of progress towards lower altitudes. Aside from the marked change
in the atmosphere, there was a corresponding one in the flora.</p>
<p>Near the summit of El Roble we were gratified in finding large
patches of strawberries. They were sweet reminders of home, as they
were of the same species as our own fragrant <i>Fragaria</i>. These
slender mountain runners did not, however, bear the large fruits
afforded by our Illinois or Florida plants, but rather the small
scarlet, but richly flavored, berries one meets in an uncultivated
state in Italy and Russia.</p>
<p>Further on our way we came across another reminder of our own
country. This time it appeared in the form of long, dark-gray tufts and
festoons of that curious epiphyte&mdash;<i>Tillandsia
usneoides</i>&mdash;popularly known in the Gulf States as Spanish moss
and in Jamaica as old man&rsquo;s beard. The natives in Colombia call
it <i>barba de palo</i>&mdash;tree-beard&mdash;a much more picturesque
epithet than any of those mentioned, and another one of countless
instances of the wonderful faculty the Indian has of giving expressive
names to the objects that specially strike his fancy.</p>
<p>As we reached a still lower level, our attention was arrested by the
beauty and luxuriance of the palms and tree ferns that graced our path.
The fern trees were as remarkable for their size as for the delicacy of
their plume-like fronds. The trunks of some of them were twelve to
fifteen feet high and the leaves of their wondrous crowns&mdash;like
veritable leaves of emerald gauze&mdash;were at times as long as the
trunk was high. Gazing at these bizarre <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>forms of vegetable
life, with their dark, rough, leaf-scarred trunks, so unlike those of
surrounding trees, we could easily imagine ourselves in a forest of
those giant paleozoic Sigillari&aelig; and Lepidodendrons that
contributed so largely towards the formation of the lower coal
measures.</p>
<p>We never made any attempt to enumerate the divers species of palms
that were ever in view from the paramo to the ocean. But wherever we
saw them, whether on the elevated Andean plateau or in the humid
valleys of the Orinoco and the Magdalena, they were for us, as they
were for Linn&aelig;us, &ldquo;the princes of the vegetable
world.&rdquo; Decked with a mantle of eternal youth, with smooth,
straight trunks like the marble shafts of Athens or Palmyra, they were
not only the glory of forest and savanna, but they were also for us, as
for Martius, a symbol of immortality.</p>
<p>At Agua Larga our road bifurcated, the new and better branch veering
off to the right at a slight angle, and the old one continuing with a
similar turn to the left. Although a bright young se&ntilde;orita, who
happened to be near the parting of the ways, declared that the old road
was the one that led to Chimbe, our objective point, we chose the new
one, and for the first time since we had left the Meta, we went astray.
We did not discover our error until we had gone several miles, when an
old man, who was repairing his humble cot by the wayside, corroborated
the se&ntilde;orita&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>There was then nothing left for us but to retrace our steps. The
mistake was quite a blow to the topographical instinct of one of our
party, who had, during our long trip, particularly prided himself on
the unerring indications of his organ of locality, which rendered, he
said, the assistance of a guide superfluous. At the same time, it was
quite trying to the patience of all of us, as we were tired, hungry,
and wished to arrive at Chimbe before sundown. It was now quite evident
that we could not possibly reach <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>our destination before
nightfall. We then realized to our sorrow the truth of Balboa&rsquo;s
words, when writing to the King of Spain&mdash;&rdquo;<i>Llega el
hombre hasta donde puede y no hasta donde quiere</i>&rdquo;&mdash;One
goes as far as one can and not as far as one wishes to go. And,
recalling what the se&ntilde;orita had told us, we had likewise a
forcible reminder of the verity of Sancho Panza&rsquo;s saying:
&ldquo;Though a woman&rsquo;s counsel isn&rsquo;t worth much, he that
despises it is no wiser than he should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After getting back to the bifurcation of the road, we found that the
older branch, which we should have taken, was little better than a
rough, rocky stairway, the steps of which had been rendered extremely
slippery by a heavy rainfall a few hours before. C., our dashing and
debonair cavalier, was still suffering from the effects of this
downpour, for having lost his waterproof <i>sombrero</i>, specially
designed for travel in the tropics, he had nothing left but a light
straw hat, which afforded the head no more protection than a sieve.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, he was suspected of intentionally discarding his
waterproof headgear, as, in his estimation, it did not comport with the
dignity of a caballero who would trace his lineage back to one of the
noblest grandees of Spain, and who, during his journey from Trinidad,
had been the recipient of special attention from young and old as well.
He seemed to be the special favorite of well-to-do matrons,
particularly in the towns and cities in which our sojourn was somewhat
protracted. Was it that they would fain have seen in the handsome young
traveler a prospective son-in-law? Not being a mind reader, I must
leave the question unanswered. As a veracious narrator of occurrences
by the way I can only state facts and let the reader draw his own
conclusions.</p>
<p>But what a road it was, that now lay between us and Chimbe! To us,
in the declining rays of the setting sun, it appeared like a
cobblestone track after it had passed through a dozen earthquakes and
had then been set at an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href=
"#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>angle of forty-five degrees with
the horizon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7180src" href="#xd21e7180"
name="xd21e7180src">13</a> Even our mules, which were usually prepared
for any kind of a path where they could find a foothold, frequently
balked at the more difficult sections of this much-neglected highway.
Comparing the part we were now traversing with the more improved road
we had left at Agua Larga, we could not but recall the words of an
Irish engineer, regarding certain highland roads, as recorded in
Scott&rsquo;s <i>A Legend of Montrose</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Had you but seen those roads before they were
made,</p>
<p class="line">You would have held up your hands and blessed General
Wade.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">And yet this was the <i lang="es">camino real</i>, the
royal highway from the Magdalena to the national capital. President
Reyes was doubtless right when he publicly stated, some years ago, that
it was now in a worse condition than it was before the War of
Independence.</p>
<p>But it was also, and this afforded us some compensation for our
discomfort, the Muisca trail&mdash;the same that the subjects of the
Zipa of Bacat&aacute; and those of the Caciques of Hunsa and Sugamuxi
made use of during their bartering expeditions to the tribes beyond the
Magdalena. Along this trail they, for generations, carried their stores
of salt, textile fabrics and emeralds, and brought back, in exchange
for them, from the placers of what is now known as Antioquia, those
treasures of gold that so excited the cupidity of the conquistadores,
and which, by many of them, were considered as an adequate reward for
all the hardships they had endured to secure their possession.</p>
<p>Finally, after a long, tiresome breakneck ride over that
&ldquo;royal&rdquo; but infinitely rugged road&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Arduus, obliquus, caligine densus
opaca,&mdash;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7204src" href=

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href="#pb332" name=
"pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>We arrived at Chimbe where, fortunately, we found an appetizing
repast, and what we were then willing to consider clean and comfortable
beds, awaiting us.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, after a refreshing sleep, we were again in
the saddle and on our way to Guaduas, where we purposed spending the
night. After a brisk ride of a few hours through a picturesque country,
we reached the town of Villeta, situated in a charming and fertile
valley. Here we had a hasty breakfast and were then on our way up the
prolonged and precipitous slopes of Cune and Petaquero.</p>
<p>The Muisca trail, like the path we followed from the llanos to the
Sabana de Bogot&aacute;, was to us an interesting example of the manner
in which the Indians traced out their roads. Having neither blasting
powder nor dynamite, they were perforce obliged to go around the rocks
that were in their way. But in spite of this, owing to their thorough
familiarity with the country, they always succeeded in finding the
shortest routes from one point to another. They made it a rule,
however, never to get far away from a water supply, and, for this
reason, their roads nearly always kept close to the water courses of
the regions through which they passed. The conquistadores, who had to
be always on the alert against the Indians, and who took every
precaution against surprise and ambuscade, avoided swamps and lowlands,
and kept rather to the commanding ridges of the country on their line
of march. As a consequence, the best roads in Colombia to-day are those
traced out by the old Muisca traders and by Quesada in the north and
Robledo, Almaguer and Belalcazar in the west and south.</p>

Honda.</span></p>
</div>
<p>On our way to Guaduas from Chimbe, we observed a number of small
plantations of sugar cane, and near by there was usually a
<i>trapiche</i>, a primitive contrivance for extracting the juice from
the cane. It consisted of a thatched shed under which was a cumbersome,
creaking machine consisting essentially of three vertical cylinders
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>of wood which were kept in motion by a span of
mules or a yoke of oxen driven by a boy. The cane was fed into the
machine by a couple of women, and the juice was received into a wooden
trough. From this it was transferred into a boiler, if
<i>panela</i>&mdash;crude sugar&mdash;was desired. More frequently,
however, it was conveyed to a still, in order to be converted into
<i>aguardiente</i>, a crude distillate, rich in alcohol, of which the
natives, the country over, consume large quantities.</p>
<p>But fond as the inhabitants are of aguardiente, and <i>guarapo</i>,
the fermented juice of the sugar cane, or a mixture of sugar and water
which has undergone fermentation, the most popular drink, especially
among the poorer classes, is <i>chicha</i>. This is to the greater part
of South America what pulque is to Mexico and beer to Germany&mdash;the
national beverage. It has been so from time immemorial. Chicha was as
much esteemed by the Muiscas, before the arrival of the Spaniards, as
it is to-day; for then, as now, no festivity or celebration was
considered complete without a liberal supply of this enlivening
potation.</p>
<p>Padre Rivero, referring to the love of drink, especially of chicha,
among the Indians, says, &ldquo;Drink is their life, their glory, and
the acme of their happiness.&rdquo; The earlier historians have much to
say of the frightful orgies, as the result of over-indulgence in
chicha, that obtained among all classes on the occasions of national
festivals, or the celebration of a victory over an enemy. It is said to
be used to excess to-day, as much as in former times, but of this I
cannot speak from personal observation. All the way from Villavicencio
to Honda, we saw countless <i>estancos</i> and
<i>estanquitos</i>&mdash;licensed bars&mdash;of the type of our lowest
dram shops, where chicha is the principal drink sold; but, although we
saw many people, men and women, congregated about these places, we
never saw a single case of drunkenness or any serious disturbance of
any kind. This was not because no one had been drinking while we were
present. All had been imbibing more or less freely, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>but
they seemed so accustomed to the use of their favorite beverages that
they were no more affected by them than are the people of France and
Italy by the drinking of the wines of their respective
countries.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7252src" href="#xd21e7252" name=
"xd21e7252src">15</a></p>
<p>From what, the reader will ask, and how, is chicha prepared? It is
made from Indian corn and by an extremely simple process. It is,
indeed, the same method as was employed before the conquest.</p>
<p>First of all, the grains of maize are moistened by water and allowed
to sprout, just as barley is treated in the manufacture of beer. After
this the product is dried and roasted in a large earthen jar. Then by
means of a <i lang="es">piedra de molar</i>&mdash;a kind of crude
mortar&mdash;like the <i>metate</i>, which the Mexican uses for
reducing maize to meal, the grains are ground, and then put into hot
water and allowed to ferment. As a result of germination and the action
of hot water, the starch of the maize is converted into sugar. This, by
fermentation, is next changed into alcohol, which gives to chicha its
intoxicating property. This is less noxious than that which is produced
by boiling the maize <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335"
name="pb335">335</a>]</span>and adding to the chicha thus obtained a
certain amount of <i>panela</i>, or molasses.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7295src" href="#xd21e7295" name="xd21e7295src">16</a></p>
<p>When properly prepared, it is an agreeable and wholesome drink, not
unlike cider or light beer. I have frequently seen it used at meals by
the best families&mdash;people who would never think of serving at
their table a harmful or intoxicating beverage. B&uuml;rger, I know,
condemns it, because he asserts it is rich in fusel oil, and because,
he maintains, it has a brutalizing effect on those who use it as a
beverage. Not having seen a reliable chemical analysis of chicha, I am
not prepared to accept his view of the subject. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>The
same writer, it may be remarked, decries cassava bread, because, he
will have it, it is composed for the most part of cellulose.</p>
<p>On our way from Villeta to Guaduas, we were obliged to pass two
lofty mountain crests, El Alto del Trigo and El Alto del Raizal. It was
then again for the hundredth time that we admired the sagacity of the
mule, and the importance of having one that is familiar with service in
the mountains. If the camel deserves the epithet&mdash;&ldquo;ship of
the desert,&rdquo; the mule is entitled to being considered the
aeroplane of the mountains. For the way he scales the highest peaks,
almost rivaling the condor in the altitudes he is capable of attaining,
and the manner in which he, with perfect security, glides along the
narrow, dizzy paths of the precipitous mountain slopes, is a matter of
ever-increasing wonder. We never, I confess, became quite reconciled to
the habit all mules have of keeping on the side of the path next to the
precipice&mdash;except when they meet animals coming from the opposite
direction, when they instinctively crowd closely to the over-hanging
mountain&mdash;but we soon learned that the mule had as much care for
his safety as we had for our own, and then the danger, we at first so
much dreaded, became more apparent than real. It is curious, but a
fact, that a mule left to himself will almost always follow in the
footsteps made by his predecessor, and no persuasion can induce him to
deviate from the beaten path. So regular and so constant is his pace
that one could almost determine in advance the number of steps he will
make from one point to another.</p>
<p>He rarely stumbles and still more rarely does he fall. And no matter
how deep may be the chasm along whose brink he carefully feels his way,
he never suffers from vertigo nor makes a false step. Certain travelers
tell us blood-curdling stories about their mules losing their balance
and plunging headlong into dark, deep ravines, but during all my
travels among the Andes, I never heard of such a thing and, from what I
know of the supreme carefulness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337"
href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>of the mule when in dangerous
places, such an accident seems most unlikely. If he is overloaded, he
files a protest by lying down and refusing to rise until relieved of a
part of his burden. Occasionally, too, when he reaches a suitable level
spot, he may take it into his head to have a roll, and he incontinently
proceeds to gratify this inclination before his rider is aware of his
intention.</p>
<p>I recall particularly how disconcerted and disgusted C. was on one
occasion, when his mule, on arriving at a specially dusty place in the
road, lay down without giving the slightest notice of his purpose and
proceeded to take a roll, before his rider was able to extricate
himself from his uncomfortable position. For a proud caballero who,
when he happened to be the cynosure of a group of admiring
se&ntilde;oritas and faded dames of quality, would fain pose as a scion
of Castilian nobility, this was an indignity that merited condign
punishment. The consequence was that whenever, thereafter, C. noticed a
suspicious movement in his mount, he forthwith proceeded to ply him
with a tough, pliable rod from a coffee bush, which had the effect of
distracting, at least temporarily, the mule&rsquo;s attention to
matters of greater moment.</p>
<p>Among the many objects that were to us a source of constant wonder
and delight in the tropics were the butterflies. We met them in
countless species in the most unexpected places, especially during our
journeyings in the lower altitudes. Here we found them of the most
brilliant hues and of every color of the spectrum. In some districts,
as for instance between the Nevada de Santa Marta and the sea, there
are at times clouds of them, and their number is then comparable only
with the millions of medus&aelig; that people certain parts of the
ocean. At times owing to their prodigious numbers and their gorgeous
colors, one could, without a great stretch of the imagination, fancy
one&rsquo;s self gazing at fluttering bits of a shattered rainbow. The
largest and most beautiful is the <i>Morpho <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>Cypris</i>, having an expanse of wing of fully
six inches, a bright cobalt-blue above, and ocellated underneath.</p>
<p>According to Hettner,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7344src" href=
"#xd21e7344" name="xd21e7344src">17</a> the people around Muso, where
the celebrated emerald mines are located, will have it that there is a
mysterious relationship between the mineral emeralds buried in the
earth and &ldquo;animal emeralds&rdquo; that flit through the air. How
like the fancy of the aborigines of Trinidad&mdash;that the glittering
colibris formerly occurring in such numbers in that island were the
souls of departed Indians!</p>
<p>Quite rivaling the butterflies in splendor and adornment are the
beauteous humming birds that are met with from ocean level to mountain
summit. Poets and naturalists have essayed in vain to portray their
marvelous richness of coloring and their magic evolutions as they dart
from flower to flower, or balance themselves above some bright fragrant
corolla while drawing from it its precious nectar. As well might the
painter try to transfer to canvas the glories of the setting sun as to
copy the iridescent hues of such glowing mites of the feathered tribe
as the Ruby Throat or the Fiery Topaz. Truly, they as well as the noted
paradiseines of New Guinea should come under the expressive designation
of birds of Paradise.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7351src" href=
"#xd21e7351" name="xd21e7351src">18</a></p>
<p>After a hard day&rsquo;s ride we reached Guaduas just as the sun had
dropped behind the mountain to the west. Guaduas in Spanish signifies
bamboos, and the town was given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339"
href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>this name on account of the
large number of these giant, tree-like grasses that formerly grew in
and about the place. Even now numerous clumps of bamboo may be seen
here, especially along the many water courses which intersect the
delightful valley in which the town is located.</p>
<p>It is really remarkable for how many purposes the bamboo is used in
the equatorial regions. It is employed in building houses, bridges,
rafts, fences, for making planks, beams, rafters, bedsteads, benches,
tables, buckets and small vessels for holding molasses, aguardiente and
other fluids, and for various other domestic utensils too numerous to
mention. Indeed, to the poorer classes of the Colombian Andes, it is
almost as useful as is the banana plant to the native of Uganda, who
contrives to get from it everything he uses except meat and iron.</p>
<p>In the plaza of the town there is a monument erected to the
patriotic heroine, Policarpa Salavarrieta, who was shot in
Bogot&aacute; during the War of Independence, by order of the viceroy,
for the part she took in assisting those who were fighting against the
mother country. Throughout Colombia her memory is held in benediction,
and the story of her tragic death has been a favorite theme for poet
and historian as well.</p>
<p>Our first view of Guaduas, in its charming setting of perennial
verdure, illumined by the crimson glow of the setting sun, was a
picture of surpassing charm. It bodied forth all the tranquillity,
verdancy and loveliness which Humboldt found in Ibague than which</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Nil quietius, nil muscosius, nil
am&oelig;nius.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The spell was broken, however, when we entered the
town. We then found to our regret that it was another of so many
instances where</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Distance lends enchantment to the
view.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So favorably situated and with so agreeable a climate,
it could easily be made one of the most delightful places of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>residence in the republic. Let us hope that this
is what it shall be in the approaching dawn of a new era.</p>
<p>Before leaving Bogot&aacute;, we had been told by a noted English
traveler to be on the lookout for a remarkable view towards the west,
from the summit of El Alto del Sargento. &ldquo;Be sure not to miss
it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for from that point you will behold one of
the most magnificent panoramas in the world.&rdquo; We were at first
inclined to regard this statement as the usual exaggeration of the
tourist, but were, nevertheless, eager to contemplate a prospect so
famed for beauty and sublimity.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7398src"
href="#xd21e7398" name="xd21e7398src">19</a></p>
<p>In order to reach the crest of the mountain, before the clouds
gathered about El Sargento, which usually occurs about midday, we made
an early start from our posada, where we had found commodious and
fairly comfortable quarters, and were soon on our way up the last of
the <i>Serranias</i>&mdash;mountain ridges&mdash;that separated us from
the Magdalena valley.</p>
<p>It was about eleven o&rsquo;clock when we arrived at the summit of
El Sargento. We had just rounded a tree-covered eminence, that
concealed the view towards the west, when all of a sudden, there burst
upon our vision, what was, to me at least, the most superb spectacle I
had ever contemplated. C. and I instinctively stood still in silent
rapture. As the picture appeared to us, it surpassed by far all that
had been said in its praise. Not even half the truth had been told. Our
emotion was too great for words, and, as we paused in mute admiration,
one of us at least recalled a similar experience enjoyed by three other
travelers in the Guadarrama mountains of Spain. It is thus recorded in
Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>The Spanish Student</i>:<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="line">&ldquo;Victorian. This is the highest point.</p>
<p class="line xd21e3826">Here let us rest.</p>
<p class="line">See, Preciosa, see how all about us,</p>

<p class="line">Receive the benediction of the sun.</p>
<p class="line">O glorious sight!</p>
<p class="line">Preciosa. Most beautiful indeed!</p>
<p class="line">Hypolito. Most wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In the foreground beneath our feet, was the wooded
slope of El Sargento. In the distance, near the mountain&rsquo;s base,
were the picturesque towns of San Juan and Ambalema. Further on, like
an immense opalescent band, was the meandering Magdalena. Beyond it
were the broad plains of Mariquita, which extended as far as the
foothills of the Central Cordillera. Over and above these, veiled in an
azure haze, and piercing the clouds, were the snow-crowned mass of Ruiz
and the Mesa de Herveo, and slightly to the left, but towering above
all the neighboring peaks, was Tolima, the giant of the Colombian
Andes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7436src" href="#xd21e7436" name=
"xd21e7436src">21</a></p>
<p>But it was not merely the physical features just mentioned, that
produced the admirable picture that held us spellbound. It was the
marvelous combination of light and shade, the position of the sun in
the heavens, and the strange optical illusions caused by the bright and
fleecy clouds that constantly swept over the landscape. These factors
gave rise to an ever-changing perspective, and at times, exaggerated
distances and magnitudes in the most extraordinary manner. Each change
developed a new picture and each one was, if possible, more beautiful
than that which it replaced. It seemed as if the genius of the Andes
wished to give us, as we were leaving his domain, a series of
dissolving views on a stupendous scale. View succeeded view with
kaleidoscopic rapidity, all distinguished by color-schemes of supreme
delicacy and splendor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href=
"#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>At one time we caught a glimpse of
a cloud-grouping that recalled Raphael&rsquo;s <i>Disputa</i>. Perhaps
in his Umbrian home Nature had gladdened the great artist&rsquo;s soul
with a similar view. Perhaps he had caught it from some lofty peak of
the Apennines while gazing at the apparition of the morning sun from
beneath the blue waters of the Adriatic.</p>
<p>Who can tell? What we do know is that he has reproduced in the
exquisite creations of his transcendent genius just such cloud-effects
as rejoiced our vision on that memorable day when we bade adieu to the
Eastern Cordilleras. Never before had mountain scenery occasioned us
keener delight. Only once before had it been my privilege to
contemplate a vista at all approaching the one that unfolded itself
before us in the picturesque valley of the Magdalena. That was long
years ago, as I stood on the summit of Mt. Parnassus. It was a balmy
morning in summer. &ldquo;Rosy-fingered dawn&rdquo; was just making her
appearance beyond the plain where Troy once stood, and was hastening to
gladden by her smile the islands of the &AElig;gean and the one-time
famous land of Hellas. Then I beheld, spread out before me, the greater
part of Greece, together with the countless islands that engirdle it.
It was a panorama which I then thought was unequaled in the wide world.
But beautiful, sublime, glorious as it undoubtedly was, it has since
yielded the palm to the unrivaled vista that greeted us from the summit
of El Sargento.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How Turner and Ruskin,&rdquo; we exclaimed, &ldquo;would have
reveled in such scenic splendor! How it would have delighted the heart
of Claude Lorrain, the painter of idyllic scenes and the master of
aerial perspective! What ecstatic joy would not Gaspard and Nicholas
Poussin, Ruysdael and Corot, have experienced in the presence of such
exuberant vegetation, such sparkling streams and fleece-like clouds,
such grandiose mountains with their spotless mantles of eternal
snow!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>And how such a spot as El Sargento would have appealed to the
esthetic soul of St. Benedict or to such lovers of wild nature as St.
Bruno, or St. Francis, the <i>poverello</i> of Assisi! Had they found
such a place, it would undoubtedly have been chosen as a site for a
temple, like our Lady of the Angels, or a monastic retreat like that of
Monte Casino or the Grande Chartreuse.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>We were still under the spell of the matchless pictures engraved on
our memories long after we had started on our way down the mountain.
Before we had realized it, we had passed from the <i>tierra
templada</i> to the <i>tierra caliente</i>. We were again in the dense
and luxuriant forests of the lowlands&mdash;in a region of perpetual
summer, like unto that which we had left behind us in the valleys of
the Meta and the Orinoco. We had left the habitat of the coffee plant
and the oak and were now in the territory of the cacao and the tolu
tree, the vanilla vine and the moriche palm. Far above and behind us,
on lofty mountain peaks where sunbeams &ldquo;glide apace with shadows
in their train,&rdquo; were the favorite haunts of the fleet and
sporting Oreades. Our path was now through a dense, gloomy forest where
Silence and Twilight,</p>
<div class="lgouter">

</div>
<p class="first">It was in such a sombre forest as this, we fancied,
where, under the influence of a fertile soil, perpetual warmth and
humidity, the teeming earth, in later geologic time, fed the countless
monsters that depended on her bounty. It was amid such surroundings
that they were wont to hold high <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344"
href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>carnival, or engage in that
struggle for existence which resulted in the survival of the fittest,
until finally all were swept away by some fatal agency of which we know
so little. Had we seen a megatherium or a mylodon or a megalonyx
crossing our path, or observed a mastodon pushing his bulky form
through the dense underbrush; had we seen a screaming pterodactyl
passing over our heads, or beheld a giant iguanodon floundering in the
morass by the wayside, or browsing on the succulent crowns of the
<i>Mauritia flexuosa</i>, we should have regarded it all as in perfect
keeping with our environment.</p>
<p>Our reveries were suddenly disturbed by the soft, dulcet notes of
the <i>tiple</i>. Only a short distance ahead of us, reclining against
a mango tree, was an amorous young mestizo, who was fondly gazing on
his dusky <i>querida</i>, while thrumming his instrument. She, during
the serenade<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7498src" href="#xd21e7498"
name="xd21e7498src">24</a> of her ardent suitor, sat on the door-sill
of a bamboo dwelling with a palm-thatched roof, having seemingly no
thought beyond satisfying the cravings of two little nude, paunchy,
bananniverous urchins, apparently her brother and sister&mdash;Pablo
and Julia by name&mdash;who, like ebony statuettes, were standing at
her knee and clamoring for another banana from a bunch suspended from a
rafter above the cabin door.</p>
<p>Farther on was another cabin, from which issued coarser notes of
shouts and laughter. It was a <i>chicheria</i>, and the chicha there
served was evidently the cause of the good nature and general merriment
that prevailed. We then discovered that we were on the outskirts of a
small pueblo, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>just across the river from the goal of our
day&rsquo;s journey. Our long, yet delightful ride across the oriental
Andes was at an end. Crossing a steel suspension bridge, the noblest
structure of the kind in the republic&mdash;which here spans
Colombia&rsquo;s great waterway&mdash;we were in Honda, the head of
navigation for the lower Magdalena. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Chibchas, like many people living on the Andean plateaus to-day,
derived their chief sustenance from potatoes and maize, both of which
are indigenous to South America. Oviedo speaks of the potato as their
principal aliment, as it was always served with whatever else they ate.
According to Castellanos, it was a favorite article of diet with the
conquistadores, as well as with the Indians.</p>
<p class="footnote">Maize afforded them meat and drink, for out of it
they made bread and their highly-prized beverage, <i>chicha</i>, which
is still so popular among their descendants. Of the paramount
importance of this article of food among the aborigines of the New
World, John Fiske, in his valuable work, <i>The Discovery of
America</i>, writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Maize or Indian corn has played a most
important part in the history of the New World, as regards both the red
men and the white men. It could be planted without clearing or
ploughing the soil. It was only necessary to girdle the trees with a
stone hatchet, so as to destroy their leaves, and let in the sunshine.
A few scratches and digs were made in the ground with a stone digger,
and the seed once dropped in took care of itself. The ears could hang
for weeks after ripening, and could be picked off without meddling with
the stalk; there was no need of threshing or winnowing. None of the Old
World cereals can be cultivated without much more industry and
intelligence.&rdquo; Vol. 1, pp. 27, 28. M. Alphonse de Candolle, in
his learned work, <i>Origin of Cultivated Plants</i>, seems to regard
Colombia as the original home of maize, while he inclines to the
opinion that Chile was the point of departure of the
potato&mdash;<i>Solanum tuberosum</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Crossing a mountain range like the Oriental Cordilleras, is not, as is
so frequently imagined, a gradual and uninterrupted ascent to the
summit, and then a similar continuous descent to its base. Far from it.
It is literally an ever-recurring journey &ldquo;up the hill and down
the dale,&rdquo; from the foothills on one side of the range to the
foothills on the other. The accompanying diagram from Karsten&rsquo;s
<i lang="fr">G&eacute;ologie de l&rsquo;Ancienne Colombie

Notwithstanding the statements, frequently made by travelers, about
their mules climbing roads inclined at angles varying from 30&deg; to
45&deg;, it can safely be affirmed that the maximum angle is but
little, if any more than 20&deg;, as actual measurement will show. When
the inclination becomes greater than this the mule will always take a
zigzag course, so as to reduce the grade as much as
possible.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd21e7180src">&uarr;</a></p>

not pretend to deny that drunkenness exists in Colombia. Even Colombian
writers would be the last to do this, for they are fully aware of the
extent of the ravages of the drink evil. They will tell you frankly
that the inhabitants of certain parts of the country are addicted to
intoxication, or, as one of them expresses it, that they are
&ldquo;<i lang="es">muy amigos de embriagarse</i>&rdquo;&mdash;fond of
getting drunk. And no one, I think, will deny that the prevalence of
the drink habit is one of the country&rsquo;s greatest curses. A good
old padre, learned and patriotic, wrote a book some decades ago, in
which he contended that Colombia, by reason of its favored geographical
position and its wonderful natural resources, should rank among the
richest and most prosperous countries of the New World. And it would
be, he insisted, were it not for three drawbacks. These, in his
estimation, were <i lang="es">borracheria</i>, <i lang=
"es">holgozaneria</i> and <i lang="es">politiqueria</i>, to-wit,
drunkenness, indolence, and the habit, so universally prevalent, of its
people dabbling in questionable politics. We have no equivalent in
English for the expressive word, <i lang="es">politiqueria</i>,
although we should have frequent use for it if it existed. It means,
literally, the methods and occupation of a politicaster&mdash;an
individual who is as much of a drawback to the best interests of our
own country as is the <i lang="es">politicastro</i> to Colombia.</p>
<p class="footnote">To the great amount of chicha sold in these
estancos, usually kept by women, is undoubtedly traceable the origin of
the saying, <i lang="es">Toda chichera muere rica</i>&mdash;Every

According to Franz Keller and other travelers in South America, the
Indian women in certain parts of the continent prepare chicha by
masticating the maize, just as some of the Polynesians prepare kava and
certain other of their favorite beverages by mastication. They claim
that when thus prepared it has a far more agreeable flavor than when
prepared <i lang="es">artificialmente</i>, that is, by the method above
described. See <i>The Amazon and Madeira Rivers</i>, p. 164 et seq.,
London, 1874.</p>

that this mode of preparing a fermented liquor out of maize, mandioca
flour or bananas, is found among the various Indian tribes of America,
and seems peculiar to this race.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="footnote">Sir Robert Schomburgk, referring to the
intoxicating drink, paiwori, made from cassava bread, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;The women, who prepare the beverage,
assemble around a large jar or other earthen vessel, and having
moistened their mouths with fresh water, they commence chewing the
bread, collecting in the vessel the moisture which accumulates in the
mouth. This is afterwards put into a trough, called canaua, or in large
jars, in which a quantity of the charred bread has been broken up, over
which boiling water is poured; and it is then kneaded, and portions
which are not of an even consistency are again carried to the mouth,
ground with the teeth, and returned into the earthen pot. The process
is repeated several times, from the idea that it conduces to the
strength of the beverage. The second day fermentation begins, and on
the third the liquor is considered fit for use. We have seen a whole
village, young and old, men and women, occupied in this disgusting
process when it was contemplated to celebrate our unexpected arrival
among them; otherwise, for common use, the females alone employ
themselves <i>ex officio</i> with the preparation. Their teeth suffer
so much from this occupation that a female has seldom a good tooth
after she is thirty years old.... The taste of the paiwori is very
refreshing after great fatigue, and not unpleasant to the taste; if
offered as the cup of welcome by the Indian, it would be a great
offense to refuse it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Discovery of Guiana</i>, ut

Honda, but I never stop there longer than is absolutely necessary, and
I always try to avoid being there in the daytime. If I must stop there
for a few hours, I time my journey so as to arrive there at night, and
make it a point to leave before morning. Hot? I think it is the hottest
and most suffocating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347"
name="pb347">347</a>]</span>spot on earth. It has always been a mystery
to me how people can live there at all. I know of nothing to compare it
with except one of the burning pits of Dante&rsquo;s
Inferno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had we not learned by long experience how to discount such
statements, the prospect of spending some days in a town with such a
reputation for grilling the stranger within its gates, would have been
anything but inviting. But we had heard similar reports about the
llanos and the valley of the Orinoco, and had found, on arriving in
these regions, that the temperature said to prevail there had been
greatly exaggerated. The same we found to be true of Honda. During our
sojourn there, our thermometer never registered more than 86&deg; F. in
the shade. Of course, around midday it was uncomfortable in the sun,
but I have been in many places in the United States where I suffered
more from the heat than I did in Honda.</p>
<p>The town is about seven hundred feet above sea level and counts
nearly four thousand inhabitants. It is separated into two parts by the
river Guali, which here enters the Magdalena. Being the centre of
traffic for Bogot&aacute;, the upper Magdalena, and the mining district
round about Mariquita, it is a place of considerable importance. As
soon, however, as the Colombian National Railway, now nearing
completion, shall have connected Girardot with Bogot&aacute;, Honda
will lose the commercial supremacy it has maintained for nearly three
centuries. There will then be little reason for a town in this place,
and it will lapse into a straggling village similar to many others
along the river.</p>
<p>And the Muisca Trail, over which we had so delightful a ride, will
be no longer needed, and will soon disappear in the dense and rank
vegetation through which it passes. Then, too, will disappear those
long and picturesque mule-trains, that so often crowded us to the
roadside on our way from Bogot&aacute;, and which have been almost the
sole means employed for the transportation of freight and passengers
since the capital was founded by Quesada nearly four centuries
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>ago. We shall always congratulate ourselves that
we were able to make the trip on mule-back rather than by a railway
train. We can thus feel that we have, to a great extent, seen the
country as it was in colonial times&mdash;before its character was
modified by the innovations of modern progress and the introduction of
modern inventions.</p>
<p>In 1805 Honda was visited by a terrific earthquake, from the effects
of which it has never recovered. Everywhere are evidences of the
frightful cataclysm. Some of the largest and most important structures
are still in ruins. Nor has any attempt ever been made to restore
certain quarters of the town to their prior condition.</p>
<p>After a few days&rsquo; halt at Honda, we were ready to continue our
journey towards the Caribbean. The rapids of the Magdalena make it
impracticable for steamers to ascend the river as far as the town. For
this reason, it is necessary to go by rail to La Dorada, eighteen miles
northwards. But, although the distance is so short, it takes two hours
for the train to make the run. The road, however, passes through a
picturesque country and time passes pleasantly and quickly. Before one
realizes it, one is at La Dorada, where the transfer is made to the
steamer bound for Barranquilla.</p>
<p>There are several lines of steamboats plying between La Dorada and
Barranquilla and intermediate points. But all the boats, which are
stern-wheelers, are quite small. The largest of them will not carry
more than four hundred tons. Usually the tonnage is much less&mdash;not
more than one or two hundred tons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7572src"
href="#xd21e7572" name="xd21e7572src">2</a> Our boat, which was
recommended as the best and the most comfortable on the river, was one
of the largest and newest, but, if it was the best, it is difficult to
conceive what the others must have been. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>A glance was sufficient to convince us that the craft on the
Magdalena are in every way inferior to those on the Orinoco and its
affluents. The Venezuelan boats are larger, and with incomparably
better equipment and appointments. They are clean, well kept, and the
service is good. Their cabins are commodious and well ventilated. They
are, besides, provided with all necessary furniture and the berths are
as comfortable as could be desired.</p>
<p>But how different is it on the Magdalena boats! In the cabins, in
place of berths with neat bedding, there is a bare cot, usually of
questionable cleanliness. Each passenger is supposed to supply his own
bedding. As to lavatories and bathrooms, those that we saw were filthy
beyond description. Our stewards were half-dressed, barefooted,
slovenly, unwashed negro boys, who seemed to have been picked up on the
streets at random, just before the boat left its moorings. The cuisine
and service were in keeping with everything else, and left very much
room for improvement. The natives, having nothing better, seemed to be
satisfied with the conditions that obtained. The foreigners, however,
and there were representatives of several nationalities aboard, could
never become reconciled to the lack of so many things essential to
comfortable traveling, and were always glad when their river
experiences were at an end.</p>
<p>For ourselves, who had been roughing it so long, the trip down the
river was not so trying as it was for many others. We were, besides,
better prepared for such a journey than the other passengers. We had
our camping outfits with us, together with clean bedding, which had
received the attention of the laundress before we left Bogot&aacute;.
We had, besides, good cumare hammocks, and mosquito nets, so that we
had nothing to apprehend from filth, vermin or insects. Thus equipped,
we really enjoyed our voyage on the Magdalena, but we were probably the
only ones who did.</p>
<p>After we had gotten fairly started down stream, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>could contemplate at our leisure the rich
tropical vegetation that fringed both banks, our minds reverted to the
first trip made down this river by Europeans. The travelers were the
celebrated conquistadores, of whom mention has already been made, viz.,
Quesada, Belalcazar and Federmann. They embarked with a number of
soldiers at Guataqui, a short distance above Honda. But they had
scarcely started on their downward course, before they encountered the
rapids at the mouth of the Guali. They were then obliged to unload
their two brigantines and canoes and transport their contents to the
lower part of the cataract, whence, after reloading, they were able to
proceed again on their long journey to Cartagena.</p>
<p>It was while passing this point that Quesada learned from his Indian
boatmen of the existence of gold in the valley of the Guali. In
consequence of this information, the town of Marquita was founded
without delay, and has ever since been a mining centre of considerable
importance. It was in this place that Quesada died after his return
from Spain. From here his remains were transferred to the Cathedral of
Bogot&aacute;, where they still repose.</p>
<p>According to Padre Simon, Quesada and his companions were
frequently, during their journey down the river, attacked by Indians,
&ldquo;who came out to salute them and speed their way with a shower of
poisoned arrows.&rdquo; &ldquo;With the help of God,&rdquo; he
continues, &ldquo;joined to eternal vigilance, their own valor and a
liberal supply of powder and firearms with which the soldiers of
Belalcazar were provided, they were able finally to arrive at
Cartagena, and give the first information regarding the great campaign
in which Quesada and his followers had achieved such signal
success.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7591src" href="#xd21e7591"
name="xd21e7591src">3</a></p>
<p>The Magdalena, like many other water courses in South America, was
at first known as the Rio Grande&mdash;the great river. It was
subsequently given the name it now bears <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb351" href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>in honor of St. Mary
Magdalene.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7598src" href="#xd21e7598" name=
"xd21e7598src">4</a> At times it is comparatively narrow and deep. Then
navigation is easy and without danger. At other times,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Shallow, disreputable, vast</p>
<p class="line">It spreads across the western plains.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then progress is difficult, and the boat may run into
a sand bar at any moment. And if the river should then be falling, it
may be impossible to get the craft free until the water rises. Only a
short time before our trip one of the steamers had been held in a sand
bank for forty days. As it was not near any place where provisions
could be obtained, the passengers suffered greatly from hunger, not to
speak of the suspense and enforced detention on an uncomfortable
boat.</p>
<p>Owing to the shallowness of the river, the boat was, during the
first part of the voyage, always tied up for the night at the first
tree or stump that might be found on the bank at sunset. The following
morning we were supposed to resume our journey at daybreak, but, as the
firemen did not begin to get up steam before that time, it was usually
an hour after sunrise before we were under way. We stopped at every
village and warehouse along the river, sometimes to deliver the mail,
often consisting of only a single letter or package, or to take on a
passenger. Two or three times a day, also, we halted to take on wood to
supply the furnace with fuel, for here, as on the Meta, coal is not
used. Fortunately, we were never obliged, as on the Meta, to delay
until the wood could be cut. Large wood piles are found every few miles
all along the river. They usually belong to a negro, who has a hut or
shed near by, together with a small garden and a few domestic animals
which supply him and his family with food in their sequestered
home.</p>
<p>We stopped at several large warehouses, many of them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>constructed of corrugated iron from the United
States. This seems strange in a land where timber is so abundant. But
there are no sawmills in the Magdalena valley. South of
Barranquilla&mdash;where but little lumber is produced&mdash;imported
lumber would be more expensive and less durable than iron. At these
places the chief articles of merchandise are coffee, cacao, hides and
vegetable ivory. This last product, also called ivory nuts, is the
fruit of a species of palm known as <i>Phytelephas
macrocarpa</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7617src" href="#xd21e7617"
name="xd21e7617src">5</a> and constitutes, in this part of Colombia, an
important article of commerce. For many things it is a good substitute
for elephant ivory, which it rivals in whiteness, beauty and solidity,
and collecting it for shipment gives occupation to quite a number of
the poor inhabitants of the Magdalena valley.</p>
<p>We usually went ashore at the different landing places to see the
people and familiarize ourselves with their mode of life. It was
generally as simple and primitive as possible&mdash;almost as
primitive, in some instances, as we conceive it to have been in the
Quaternary period or in the days of the Troglodytes. Often their
dwellings were little more than palm-thatched sheds&mdash;barely
sufficient to shield their occupants from sun and rain. A <i>tulpa</i>,
consisting of three stones, served them in lieu of a stove, and on this
they broiled the fish caught in the river, or prepared their
<i>arepas</i>&mdash;corn cakes&mdash;or their <i>sancocho</i>, a kind
of ragout, as popular in some parts of Colombia as it is in
Venezuela.</p>
<p>We were surprised to see in the houses and shops along the Magdalena
valley&mdash;what we had often observed in various parts of Colombia
and Venezuela&mdash;the large number of illustrated circulars of
Spanish, English and French proprietary medicines. The insides of
certain houses were sometimes quite plastered over with them. But what
was more surprising was the number of lithographs we saw of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>the German Emperor. Sometimes he was represented
alone, at others he was depicted as surrounded by the members of his
family. In several places we saw pictures not only of the emperor and
his family, but also those of his father and grandfather and Bismarck.
And the remarkable thing about it was that, in some cases, there were
no Germans living within hundreds of miles of where we came across
these pictures. Had some enthusiastic Teuton tried to start a
propaganda in favor of the Vaterland by distributing broadcast these
engravings of the imperial family? I know not, but, judging solely from
the number of their pictures we came across in Venezuela and Colombia,
one would be led to suppose that the Hohenzollern rulers are the most
popular of potentates, at least in this part of South America.</p>
<p>While stopping to take on some rubber at a certain small village, we
had a remarkable illustration of the rapidity with which the bed of the
river is sometimes changed, even when the water is comparatively low.
We had scarcely reached the landing place when there was a terrific
crash, occasioned by the falling in of a large section of the bank on
which the village was built. Soon afterwards another section gave way,
and then a third and a fourth. The whole bank seemed to be undermined
by the river, and, although the warehouse was fully fifty feet away
from the water when we arrived, so much of the bank had been carried
away in less than half an hour, that not only the contents of the
building, but also the building itself had to be hurriedly removed in
order that it and the merchandise stored within might not be borne away
by the resistless current. As the structure was of light bamboo, and
put together with a view to such an emergency, the transfer was not a
difficult task. When we started to continue our course, it looked as if
the eroding action of the river would necessitate the changing of the
site of the entire village before nightfall.</p>
<p>Such changes in the course of the river are not uncommon.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>They are going on all the time in some part or
other of the valley. One may frequently see immense masses of earth
suddenly detached, which are a serious menace to the champans<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7645src" href="#xd21e7645" name=
"xd21e7645src">6</a>&mdash;large covered flat-boats&mdash;and other
small craft that happen to pass by at the time. Sometimes the giants of
the forest are thus wrested from their footholds, and may be seen
drifting down stream together with masses of vegetation attached to
them. At times, too, masses of earth, like floating islets, are
visible, and may travel a long distance down stream before their course
is arrested by an island or a sand bar.</p>
<p>Ordinarily the changes in the river bed are gradual and occasion
little danger to life or property. Sometimes, however, during the rainy
season, and when the flood is unusually high, widespread devastation is
the result. Whole villages are swept away by the deluge; and towns,
that were before important commercial centres, are suddenly isolated
and left far from the navigable part of the river. Places that before
were favorably situated are, after the flood, found to be in the midst
of pestiferous morasses. Such has been the fate of many places along
the waterways of Colombia, but more notably in the great island of
Mompos, near the confluence of the Cauca and the Magdalena. Here
several places that were at one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>time centres of industrial
and agricultural activity, have long since either ceased to exist or
lost entirely their pristine importance.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e7659width" id="p354"><img src="images/p354.jpg"
alt="Champan Going Up the Magdalena." width="720" height="471">
<p class="figureHead">Champan Going Up the Magdalena.</p>
</div>
<p>The town of Mompos is probably the most remarkable example of this
kind. Founded in 1539 by Alonso de Heredia, it is one of the oldest
towns in the republic, and was for generations the most important
commercial centre between Cartagena and Honda. But owing to a
displacement of the main channel of the river, and the filling in of
the branch of the river on which the town was built, it is now
practically deprived of its former means of communication with the rest
of the country, and is rapidly verging towards extinction.</p>
<p>The Magdalena, as a commercial highway, has been much neglected. As
a consequence, no one can calculate when leaving Honda, how long it
will take him to reach Barranquilla. It may require five or six days,
or it may demand twice that much time. All depends on the shifting bed
of the river, or the blocking of the channel by sand bars and
accumulations of floating timber. By reason of these obstructions and
the ever-varying depth of the main channel, navigation is usually
impossible at night, except below the island of Mompos, where the
volume of water is swelled by the tribute of the mighty Cauca.</p>
<p>If the Magdalena were under the supervision of a corps of competent
engineers, having at their disposal the necessary dredges and other
appliances for keeping the main channel in prime condition, a properly
constructed boat would easily make the trip from Honda to the mouth of
the river in two days, and traverse the same course up stream in three
days at most. It is really a pity to see such a splendid water course
so neglected. If cared for as it should be, it could easily be rendered
an artery for inland commerce of the first importance. As it is,
transportation, as now carried on, is always slow and uncertain, and
never free from danger and disaster. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span></p>
<p>As a serviceable means of communication with the outside world we
were constantly contrasting the Magdalena with the Meta. From our
observations, we should consider the Meta, from its junction with the
Orinoco to Cabuyaro or even to the mouth of the Humea, as a safer
waterway than the Magdalena. Only twice did our boat graze a sand bank
in the Meta, but it continued its course without a moment&rsquo;s
stoppage. In the Magdalena, however, we frequently ran into sand bars,
or shallow water, and, on several occasions, had difficulty in
extricating and floating our craft. Once we were delayed for some time,
and began to fear that, owing to the falling water, we should be
stranded for weeks, as other boats had been not long before.</p>
<p>When peace shall have been firmly established in Colombia, and its
finances shall have been placed on a satisfactory basis, the patriotic
and far-seeing statesmen of the republic, will, I am convinced, see the
necessity of carrying out the plan of the former Archbishop and Viceroy
of New Granada&mdash;Don Antonio Caballero y Gongora&mdash;and
connecting Bogot&aacute; with Europe by means of the Meta and the
Orinoco. It will not be a difficult feat of engineering to build a
railroad from the capital to a suitable point on the Meta, and the
length of such a road need not exceed one hundred and fifty miles at
most. This will bring Bogat&aacute; within eight or ten hours of the
head waters of navigation, and develop the most valuable and most
productive grazing section of the country.</p>
<p>The highest point the road need reach in crossing the Eastern
Cordilleras will be less than that of several passes in Colorado, where
the Rocky Mountains are scaled by the iron-horse with a long train of
cargo behind him. The pass of Chipaque, by which we entered the
<i>altiplanicies</i> of Bogot&aacute;, is several thousand feet lower
than the heights crossed by the railways leading from the waters of the
Pacific to Lake Titicaca, and to Argentina by way of Cumbre Pass, and
is nearly a mile lower than the point <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>where the Galera
tunnel pierces the Cordillera on the way from Lima to Oroya.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7682src" href="#xd21e7682" name=
"xd21e7682src">7</a></p>
<p>What Colombia really needs is the betterment of both its great
waterways&mdash;the Meta for the eastern and the Magdalena for the
western part of the republic. Until they shall both have been put in
such condition as to be navigable during the entire year, it will be
impossible fully to develop the marvelous resources of this extensive
country. River traffic will always remain cheaper than traffic by rail,
and, on account of many physical difficulties, it is highly improbable
that certain valuable sections of territory will ever be tapped by
railroads. When, however, these two main arteries of commerce shall
have received the attention they deserve and shall have been put in
communication with the rich grazing, mining and agricultural regions by
the various lines of railway that are contemplated or in course of
construction, Colombia will at once take a position among the richest
and most flourishing republics of South America. Only those who have
traveled through it can fully realize its wonderful natural riches, or
form an adequate conception of its vast extent. Sufficient to state
that its area is more than ten times as great as the state of New York,
or as great as that of France, Germany and the British Isles
combined.</p>
<p>As to the great Pan-American line which has been projected to
connect New York with Buenos Ayres, that is talked of in Colombia as
well as in the United States. But when one contemplates the enormous
engineering difficulties to be encountered in the construction of the
section extending from Costa Rica to the frontier of Ecuador, one is
compelled to regard the project as a much more arduous undertaking than
some of its enthusiastic promoters would have us believe. Railway
communication will soon be complete <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>from Buenos Ayres to
Central Peru, and, judging by work now being accomplished in Ecuador,
steel rails will soon span the country from the northern to the
southern boundaries of this republic. But with all this work completed,
the most difficult part of the colossal enterprise will still remain
untouched. Even should the road eventually be completed, as is
possible, it is still doubtful whether long stretches of it would ever
pay even a nominal interest on the investment.</p>
<p>The part of the Magdalena valley between Honda and the island of
Mompos is but sparsely inhabited. Most of the inhabitants are Indians,
mestizos, or negroes, the descendants of former slaves.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e7693src" href="#xd21e7693" name="xd21e7693src">8</a>
On account of the heat and malaria that always prevail in the lowlands,
but few white men are found here, and their sojourn, as a rule, is only
temporary. But near the confluence of the Cauca and the Magdalena, and
thence to the Caribbean, there are rich and extensive
<i>esteros</i>&mdash;grazing lands&mdash;covered with succulent Para
and Guinea grasses, several feet high. In these broad plains, there are
no fewer than half a million cattle, not to speak of large numbers of
horses, mules and other domestic animals. Some of the cattle we saw
reminded us of the fat, sleek animals we had seen on the llanos watered
by the Rio Negro and the Humea. Under more favorable conditions the
number could greatly be increased.</p>
<p>The scenery along the Magdalena is much like that along the Meta and
the Orinoco, except that along the western river one sees more of the
mountains, especially in the southern part. The vegetation is similar
in character and quite as varied and exuberant. On both sides of the
river trees and bushes are so massed together as to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name="pb359">359</a>]</span>form
an impenetrable wall. Everywhere there is a veritable maze of creeping
plants, of bromelias, bignonias, passifloras. And everywhere, too, are
lianas&mdash;aptly named monkey-ladders&mdash;which bind tree to tree
and branch to branch. Usually they are single, like ropes&mdash;whence
their name bush ropes&mdash;but often they are twined together like
strands in a cable. Frequently they are seen descending from the
topmost part of a tree to the ground, where they forthwith strike root
and present the appearance of the stays and shrouds of a ship&rsquo;s
main mast. And where there is air and sunshine, these lianas, which
often form bights like ropes, are loaded with epiphytes of all kinds,
and decorated with the rarest and most beautiful orchids. Indeed, the
regions on both sides of the Magdalena have long been favorite resorts
for the orchid hunters in the employ of the florists and merchant
princes of the United States and Europe. From here these bizarre
vegetable forms are shipped by thousands. One enthusiastic English
collector tells us how he secured, as the result of two months&rsquo;
work about ten thousand plants of the highly prized
<i>Odontoglossum</i>. But to obtain these orchids he was obliged to
fell some four thousand trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most magnificent sight,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;for even
the most stoical observer, is the immense clumps of <i>Cattleya
Mendelii</i>, each new bulb bearing four or five of its gorgeous
rose-colored flowers, many of them growing in the full sun, or with
very little shade, and possessing a glowing color which is very
difficult to get in the stuffy hothouses where the plants are
cultivated. Some of these plants, considering their size and the
slowness of growth, must have taken many years to develop, for I have
taken plants from the trees with five hundred bulbs, and as many as one
hundred spikes of flowers, which, to a lover of orchids, is a sight
worth traveling from Europe to see.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7714src" href="#xd21e7714" name="xd21e7714src">9</a></p>
<p>It is when contemplating the marvelous variety and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>luxuriance of intertropical flora&mdash;of which
one in our northern climes can have no adequate conception&mdash;that
one is tempted to exclaim with Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;It is my faith, that every flower</p>
<p class="line">Enjoys the air it breathes.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e7729src" href="#xd21e7729" name="xd21e7729src">10</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">And if the extraordinary claims which Professors
Wagner, France and G. H. Darwin make for plants be true, viz., that
they have minds and are conscious of their existence, that they feel
pain and have memories, then, indeed, should we be disposed to regard
the exuberant and wondrously developed plants of the equatorial world
as occupying the highest plane in the evolutionary process of vegetable
life.</p>
<p>Passing the embouchure of the Opon, on the right bank of the
Magdalena, evoked, in a special manner, memories of Quesada and his
valiant band. It was here they left the Magdalena during that memorable
expedition that made them the undisputed masters of the country now
known as Colombia. More than eight months had passed since they had
started from Santa Marta on their career of discovery and conquest. The
difficulties they had to encounter and the sufferings they had to
endure were extreme. Mosquitoes, wasps, ants and other insects;
reptiles and jaguars gave them no rest, day or night. Certain kinds of
worms, the old chroniclers tell us, buried themselves in the flesh of
the exhausted and half-famished men and caused them untold agony.
Indians everywhere laid ambush for them, and assailed them with
poisoned arrows from every point of vantage. Even the elements seemed
to conspire against them. There was a continual downpour of rain, so
that it was impossible to light a fire for any purpose. Their arms were
almost destroyed by rust, and they were left without <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>a
single dry charge of powder. Their provisions became exhausted and
starvation stared them in the face. To preserve life they devoured
their sword scabbards and every article of leather they had with them.
There was incessant thunder, unchanging gloom, eternal horror, and
other features of the pit infernal. Their course was through dense
underbrush and pestiferous swamps and up precipitous acclivities,
whither they had to drag their weakened horses by long lianas that
served the purpose of ropes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7741src" href=
"#xd21e7741" name="xd21e7741src">11</a></p>
<p>Finally, after the most heroic efforts, they came to a place where
they found provisions&mdash;a veritable land of promise for the
suffering but intrepid Spaniards. They had left behind them the
inhospitable sierras of the Opon, and were on the verge of the fertile
plateau of Cundinamarca, that constituted the home of the Muiscas. Here
they found maize, potatoes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7746src" href=
"#xd21e7746" name="xd21e7746src">12</a> yucas, beans, tomatoes and, as
Padre Simon phrases it, &ldquo;a thousand other
<i>chucherias</i>&mdash;titbits&mdash;of the aborigines.&rdquo; Well
could they, in the language of Castellanos, exclaim, with
thanksgiving:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good land! A good land! A land which puts an end to our
suffering, a land of gold, a land of plenty. A land for a home, a land
of benediction, bright and serene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that the enthusiastic soldiers, whose courage would
often have faltered, had it not been for the determination and
perseverance of their invincible leader, gathered around Quesada to
congratulate him on the successful issue <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>of his great
undertaking, and to assure him of their undying loyalty in any future
enterprise in which he might require their services.</p>
<p>And well they might render the noble licentiate the meed of praise
he so well deserved, for had it not been for him, the expedition would
have been a failure, and they would undoubtedly have perished before
they could have returned to Santa Marta, as had so many of their
companions, who had turned back before the ascent of the Cordillera was
begun. To some of his officers who, in view of the unheard-of
difficulties they had to encounter, recommended that the expedition be
abandoned, he replied that he would regard as a personal enemy any one
who, in future, would make such a pusillanimous proposal and one so
foreign to Spanish valor.</p>
<p>All in all, he was one of the bravest and most humane of the
conquistadores, and successfully performed a task before which a less
valorous commander would have given up in despair. His achievements
obscure by their brilliancy and daring those of Amadis and Roldan and
are in no wise inferior to those of any of the conquistadores. They may
truthfully, in the words of Bacon, written anent a performance of Sir
Richard Grenville, be styled as &ldquo;memorable beyond credit, and to
the height of some heroical fable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quesada has taken his place in Valhalla among the greatest of the
world&rsquo;s heroes, and his memory will endure as long as splendid
deeds of prowess shall stir the souls of men. Of him and his gallant
companions one can say what Peter Martyr wrote of their countrymen in
general:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore, the Spanyardes in these owre dayes and theyr noble

<p>Lower down the Magdalena, on the left bank of the river, we
approached the scene of the exploits of another of the distinguished
conquistadores&mdash;Pedro de Heredia, the founder of Cartagena. After
he had reduced to submission the Indians who had been victorious over
Ojeda, he started towards the Magdalena, where he collected such
immense treasures of gold that when it was divided, each soldier
received no less than 6,000 ducats. This was the equivalent of $48,000
in gold at the present valuation of this metal, and was the largest
apportionment of spoil, at least, so far as private soldiers were
concerned, made during the conquest.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7779src" href="#xd21e7779" name="xd21e7779src">14</a> He
afterwards made a similar expedition to the territories drained by the
San Jorge and the Nechi, affluents of the Cauca, in search of the rich
veins whence the Indians extracted their gold. He did not find the
objects of his quest, but came across several rich cemeteries, in which
the dead had been interred with their jewels, and a sanctuary with
idols adorned with plates of gold. From these he secured treasures to
the amount of more than $3,000,000 of our money.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7782src" href="#xd21e7782" name="xd21e7782src">15</a></p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, the method Heredia resorted to of securing
gold, the rifling of the <i>huacas</i>&mdash;burial places&mdash;of the
aborigines, has been continued until the present day. There are still
men in Colombia, notably in Antioquia&mdash;<i>huaqueros</i>, they are
called&mdash;who gain a livelihood by searching for huacas and
extracting from them the gold and emeralds they frequently contain.</p>
<p>The year before our trip there appeared in an English magazine, the
following paragraph in an article purporting to give a picture of the
Magdalena valley and its life:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anchored in the forest at midnight, the traveler hears
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>the deep growl of the jaguar, the sharp squeal
of the wild cat, the howl of the howler monkey, the long moan of the
sloth, and the last scream of the wild pig, pierced by the claws of
some patient but ferocious animal ambushed during the past hour, with
many other sounds of life, terror and conflict that fall strangely on
the European ear, and, if he waits and watches until the dawn, he may
see the alligator dragging his ugly bulk out of the water, crowds of
turtles trailing on the sands, the deer and the tapir coming down to
drink, thousands of white cranes on the branches nearest to their prey,
thousands of gray ones already wading leg-deep, and many more thousands
of other birds clouding the dim horizon, all waiting for the light ere
they begin their work of life and slaughter.... With the alligators in
shoals at the bottom of the river, and the millions of birds above its
surface, one wonders how any fish are left, yet the river is always
literally teeming with fish, as though conscious of the demands it has
to meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although we were always on the alert, so as to miss nothing of
interest, especially anything that concerned the animal life of the
tropics, we must confess that in all our experience we never heard
growls, squeals, howls, moans, screams, or other sounds of terror and
conflict, either along the Magdalena or anywhere else in South America.
And we spent nearly a year in the country, and often traveled weeks at
a time in the wild virgin forest, far away from human habitations of
every kind. Nor did we ever perceive any of the animals that certain
tourists would lead one to believe can be seen in such numbers
everywhere, even from the deck of a passing steamer. Nowhere along the
Orinoco, the Meta, the Magdalena, or elsewhere, did we ever catch even
a glimpse of a jaguar or a puma, a manati or a sloth, a wild cat or a
wild pig. More than this, not once, during our entire trip through
Venezuela and Colombia, through forests and plains, did we ever see a
single monkey, except two or three that were kept as pets <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>by
the natives. This may seem an incredible statement. I would have
believed such an experience as ours to be absolutely impossible,
especially in view of what writers and travelers in South America have
told us regarding the immense number of wild animals of all kinds
everywhere visible in equatorial wilds. But I am stating a fact that I
am quite unable to reconcile with the contrary experiences of others
who, according to their own admission, have seen but little, compared
with what we saw, of the lands through which we passed. I have seen
more large game on the plains of New Mexico and Wyoming, from the
window of a Pullman car, in a single trip to and from the Pacific
coast, than I ever saw in the wilds of South America during nearly a
twelvemonth.</p>
<p>Nor did we ever see along the Magdalena, or anywhere else, the
&ldquo;thousands of white cranes on branches,&rdquo; nor the
&ldquo;thousands of gray ones wading leg-deep,&rdquo; nor the
&ldquo;many more thousands clouding the dim horizon,&rdquo; of which
the writer of the above-mentioned article professes to have been the
fortunate spectator. We rarely saw more than a few dozen cranes at a
time&mdash;never a hundred, and I have reason to believe we enjoyed
very favorable opportunities, at least during a portion of our long
journey, for seeing what was to be seen. At no time did we ever observe
as many birds in the air at one time as I have frequently seen in the
United States. I feel safe in asserting positively that the number of
wild pigeons I have frequently noted in a single flock in the United
States, would more than equal that of all the birds combined that we
saw while in the tropics.</p>
<p>Mr. F. Lorraine Petre evidently had an experience somewhat similar
to ours. In his recent work on Colombia, he tells us frankly that one
sees little of animal life on the Magdalena, that &ldquo;of the
mammalia one sees and hears little.... Of the jaguars, the pumas, the
sloths, the peccaries, the deer, the tapirs, and other animals,
dangerous or harmless, we saw or heard as little as we did of the bears
which inhabit the hills beyond. It is surprising <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366</a>]</span>that, tied up, as we often were, right against
the forest, we should not have heard the night call of the carnivora,
or the sharp bark of the frightened deer, but truth compels us to admit
that we did not, and, moreover, that the cry of even the howling monkey
did not salute us.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7813src" href=
"#xd21e7813" name="xd21e7813src">16</a></p>
<p>The number of birds observed along the Magdalena was not greater
than I have frequently seen in the valleys of the Missouri or the
Columbia. Most of these were parrots and macaws. Always noisy and
restless, always flying and climbing about, except when eating fruit or
cracking nuts, one is at times tempted to describe them as feathered
relatives of the monkey. The parrots are sometimes seen in flocks, and
their piercing cries are at times almost deafening. They are a sociable
bird and are usually seen in considerable numbers. The macaws are
remarkable for always flying in pairs, and for their brilliant colors.
Their body is flaming scarlet, their wings are tinged with various
shades of red, yellow, green and blue, while their tail is bright blue
and scarlet. They, too, like parrots, are very vociferous, and,
although they may occasionally be found in large numbers, they always
fly two and two.</p>
<p>The large animals most frequently seen along the Magdalena, as along
other tropical rivers, are those horrid monsters, &ldquo;ambiguous
between sea and land,&rdquo; the cayman and &ldquo;the scaly
crocodile.&rdquo; But even they are not so numerous as certain
travelers would have us believe. The largest number we ever saw at one
time was fifteen. They were sunning themselves on a
<i>playa</i>&mdash;sand bank&mdash;below the island of Mompos. On the
Orinoco and the Meta we never beheld more than eight at any one
time&mdash;unless we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367"
name="pb367">367</a>]</span>were to count a number of little ones, just
hatched, which Luisito, our colored boy, caught one day while we were
taking on wood on the lower Meta.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7830src"
href="#xd21e7830" name="xd21e7830src">17</a></p>
<p>The early Spaniards called all these saurians by the general name of
<i>lagartos</i>&mdash;lizards. The English afterwards spoke of a single
animal as a lagarto, whence the present name alligator. Modern writers
speak of them indiscriminately as alligators or crocodiles. As a matter
of fact, several species of both alligators and crocodiles are found in
the equatorial regions. But, notwithstanding all that has hitherto been
written about them, their distinction and definition, their
classification still remains a matter of difficulty. Some specimens
have been found whose classification is so perplexing that naturalists
are still undecided whether to regard them as crocodiles or alligators.
In this respect they are much like Shakespeare&rsquo;s two lovers,
&ldquo;Two distincts, division none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name cayman is employed in Venezuela and Colombia to designate
any of these saurians. Following the classification adopted in the
British Museum the cayman is distinct from both alligator and
crocodile. More than this. According to the British system of
classification, there are no alligators at all in South America, while,
in the waters of Colombia and Venezuela, there are two species of
crocodile and three species of cayman.</p>
<p>Probably more fabulous accounts have obtained about crocodiles than
about any other animal. In spite of the old saying to the contrary,
they never shed tears. And notwithstanding the fact that the ancient
Egyptians gave the crocodile divine honors, because, being tongueless,
it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>made in hieroglyphical writing, a symbol of the
Divinity, it is now known that the tongue of this erstwhile god is
quite large, except at the tip. Similarly, all the stories that have so
long been current about the impenetrability of the animal&rsquo;s hide,
are quite without foundation. How often have we not been told that it
is impossible to kill a crocodile, with even the best Winchester,
unless the ball enter the eye or strike under the soft, fleshy parts of
the front legs? Their plated skin is easily pierced by an ordinary
rifle or revolver, and a mortal wound ensues whenever a vital part is
penetrated.</p>
<p>Not less erroneous are the ideas that so widely prevail regarding
the ferocity of the crocodile and the cayman. On the contrary, they
are, in their native state, very timid animals, and rarely exhibit
hostility towards man, except when cornered. Then, like most other
animals, they will fight with great fierceness. They make for the water
as soon as they see one approach them, and it is often far from easy to
get near them. We often saw the natives enter rivers frequented by
crocodiles and caymans, something they surely would not have done if
the danger were as great as ordinarily imagined. In Venezuela the
Indian or mestizo has a much greater dread of the ray or carib fish
than of the cayman.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7857src" href=
"#xd21e7857" name="xd21e7857src">18</a></p>
<p>Some attempts have been made, both on the Orinoco and the Magdalena,
to secure the hides of crocodiles and caymans for commercial purposes,
but the expense of preparing them for the market proved to be so great
that the work had to be abandoned.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7868src"
href="#xd21e7868" name="xd21e7868src">19</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span></p>
<p>The early explorers of the New World had many stories to tell about
the cayman and the crocodile, and many of them have apparently survived
among the natives until the present day. But there were many other
animals that made even a greater impression on them. It will suffice to
reproduce Peter Martyr&rsquo;s quaint account of two of these
representatives of the American fauna. The first is the tapir, of which
he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is especially one beast engendered here, in which
nature hath endeuoured to shew her cunnyng. This beaste is as bygge as
an oxe, armed with a longe snoute lyke an elephant, and yet no
elephant. Of the colour of an oxe and yet noo oxe. With the houfe of a
horse, and yet noo horse. With eares also much lyke vnto an elephant,
but not soo open nor soo much hangying downe: yet much wyder then the
eares of any other beaste.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7881src"
href="#xd21e7881" name="xd21e7881src">20</a></p>
<p>The other animal that excited the wonder of Martyr and his
contemporaries was the sloth, of which he says:&mdash; &ldquo;Emonge
these trees is fownde that monstrous beaste with a snowte lyke a foxe,
a tayle lyke a marmasette, eares lyke a batte, handes lyke a man, and
feete lyke an ape, bearing her whelpes abowte with her in an owtwarde
bellye much lyke vnto a greate bagge or purse. The dead carkas of this
beaste, you sawe with me, and turned it ouer and ouer with yowre owne
handes, marueylynge at that newe belly and wonderful prouision of
nature. They say it is knownen by experience, that shee neuer letteth
her whelpes goo owte of that purse, except it be eyther to play, or to
sucke, vntyl suche tyme that they bee able to gette theyr lyuing by
them selues.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7887src" href=
"#xd21e7887" name="xd21e7887src">21</a></p>
<p>The part of the valley below the confluence of the Cauca and the
Magdalena was quite different from that above. The country contained
more inhabitants, and the dense <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370"
href="#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>forests that had hitherto
bordered the river gave place to broad savannas, on which grazed
thousands of cattle, so buried in the Para and Guinea grasses, that
frequently we could discern only their horns. Along the river banks
were the estates of well-to-do <i>haciendados</i>&mdash;some of them
foreigners&mdash;and the villages, that before were extremely rare,
became more numerous. The aspect of the country was less wild than that
through which we had just passed, and betokened a certain measure of
prosperity, at least so far as the grazing interests were
concerned.</p>
<p>We could now travel day and night, for the river was so deep that
sand bars were no longer to be apprehended. And then we had the most
delightful moonlight nights. The air was balmy and laden with an
exquisite fragrance,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora
breathes,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">a constant invitation to repose and <i>dolce far
niente</i>. The surpassing loveliness of the scene, the magic stillness
of the vast solitude through which we were so peacefully gliding, the
broad expanse of one of the world&rsquo;s great rivers, the weird
silhouettes cast by the passing palms on the moonlit waters&mdash;all
these things contributed towards rendering our last night on the river
a fitting finale to the others&mdash;all of which were in the highest
degree enjoyable. Seated on the forward deck of our steamer, we could
exclaim in the words of the choric song of Tennyson&rsquo;s
<i>Lotos-Eaters</i>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;How sweet it were, hearing the downward
stream,</p>
<p class="line">With half-shut eyes ever to seem</p>
<p class="line">Falling asleep in a half-dream!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="line">Resting weary limbs at last on beds of
asphodel.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The following morning&mdash;our last day on the
Magdalena&mdash;found us at Calamar. Here some of our fellow-passengers
disembarked to take the train to Cartagena, sixty-five miles to the
westward. From Calamar to Barranquilla, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>the chief northern
terminus of river navigation, is sixty-six miles. This distance we
expected to make in a few hours, but for reasons presently to be given,
we were unexpectedly delayed within sight of Barranquilla, the goal
that marked the completion of another important stage in our
journey.</p>
<p>Our last day on the Magdalena was a bright balmy one in June. We
spent the entire time on the forward part of the upper deck, fanned by
the delightful breezes that were wafted from the Caribbean. The river
here has about the same width as has the Mississippi at New Orleans,
but the scenery is far more attractive. It flows through a broad,
level, grass-covered savanna, which extends beyond the limits of
vision, and which is dotted here and there with small villages and
flourishing haciendas. Some of the houses near the river banks have a
most cozy appearance. They are almost embowered in a mass of flowers of
every hue, and surrounded by lofty palms whose lovely emerald coronals
were each a picture of rarest beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These princes of the vegetable world&rdquo; always had a
peculiar fascination for us, no matter where we saw them. And during
our long journey from the delta of the Orinoco they were never absent
from view even for a single hour. When one species disappeared it was
replaced by another, and thus they followed us from the Atlantic wave
to the lofty crest of Suma Paz. The ocean-loving cocoa gave place to
the moriche, and this was in turn succeeded by the corneto of the
llanos and the wax palm of the Sierras.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7929src" href="#xd21e7929" name="xd21e7929src">22</a></p>
<p>It is quite impossible for the inhabitants of our northern climes to
have anything approaching an adequate conception of the grace and
beauty and surpassing loveliness of the omnipresent palms of the
equatorial world. Away <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href=
"#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>from heat and sunshine, they are
quite devoid of the luxuriance and stateliness that characterize them
in the tropics. In Europe, for instance, there is but a single palm
that is indigenous&mdash;the <i>Cham&aelig;rops humilis</i>. The date
palm was introduced from the East. In the tropics, however, about
eleven hundred species of palms are known, and there is reason to
believe that, when this part of the world shall have been thoroughly
explored, many new species shall be discovered.</p>
<p>The habits as well as the habitats of palms were a source of
unfailing interest to us. Some are solitary and are rarely found
forming groups with other trees of their species. Others, like the date
palm, are quite gregarious and often form extensive clumps. Others
still are said to be &ldquo;social,&rdquo; because they occupy
extensive tracts almost to the entire exclusion of other kinds of
trees. Various species of <i>Mauritia</i>, <i>Attalea</i>, <i>Cocoa</i>
and <i>Copernicia</i> are social palms, and the
<i>palmares</i>&mdash;palm groves&mdash;formed by them constitute the
most attractive features of tropical landscapes.</p>
<p>We once saw near the river&rsquo;s bank a grove of this kind
composed of palms of unusual height and beauty. It had been selected as
the last resting place of the denizens of a neighboring village, and
was, to our mind, the most beautiful cemetery in the world. Could we
have our choice, we should prefer, by far, to repose under one of those
noble frond-bearing shafts to being shelved away in the costliest
marble vault of P&egrave;re Lachaise.</p>
<div class="figure xd21e7966width" id="p372"><img src="images/p372.jpg"
alt="A Palm Forest in the Tropics." width="720" height="462">
<p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">A Palm Forest in the
Tropics.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Certain palms affect the open savanna, others seek the solitudes of
the forest, while still others are most frequently found midway between
these two&mdash;that is, on the belt of land that separates forest from
plain. Some palms, like the cocoa, seem to require an atmosphere that
is slightly saline, and thrive best near the ocean&rsquo;s shore.
Others apparently attain their greatest development in marshes and
lowlands, while others again demand the arid plain or the lofty
mountain plateau. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373"
name="pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>In spite of their noble appearance and their aspect of perennial
youth, palms, as a rule, are short-lived. None of them ever attain the
age of the venerable patriarchs of our northern forests. According to
Martius, the span of a palm&rsquo;s life never exceeds that of a few
generations of men. The areca catechu runs its course in forty or fifty
years, the cocoa attains an age of one hundred or one hundred and
twenty years at most, while the date palm, which probably lives the
longest, usually rounds out its existence within the period of two
centuries.</p>
<p>Some palms, like the <i>Metroxylon</i>, for instance, never survive
fructification. It fruits but once, and then, as Martius so graphically
expresses it, &ldquo;<i lang="la">nobilis arbor mox riget, perit et
cadit</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the noble tree presently withers, perishes and
falls. But, continues the same writer, &ldquo;there is pleasure and
solace in the thought that palms never die without yielding fruit,
thereby insuring the continuance of the species.&rdquo; And then, as is
his wont when opportunity offers, he takes occasion from this
circumstance to moralize as follows: &ldquo;To labor, to flourish, to
fructify is granted not only to the palm but to man
also.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e7984src" href="#xd21e7984"
name="xd21e7984src">23</a></p>
<p>In the foregoing pages I have mentioned some of the countless uses
made of palms, especially by the inhabitants of the tropics. It would,
however, require a large volume to enumerate all the purposes for which
they are employed. It can, however, safely be asserted that no family
in the great vegetable kingdom more completely meets the necessities of
millions of people than does that of the noble and ever-beautiful
Palmace&aelig;.</p>
<p>Like Martius, we always found in the contemplation of the palm a
source of special joy and peace. To him the palm was what literature
was to Cicero, a consolation in trial and affliction, and the delight
and inspiration of maturer years. In the palm we always found something
to elevate the mind, something that fascinated us and stirred our
emotions in a manner that often surprised us. For us, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>as
for myriads of others who have lived and struggled and attained the
goal of the heart&rsquo;s desire, the palm was the emblem of victory,
of a higher and better life beyond the tomb, of a happy, glorious
immortality.</p>
<p>As we gazed in silent delight at the broad expanse of the
green-carpeted savanna, adorned with the graceful, columnar shafts and
feathery fronds of the ever-beautiful, ever-majestic palm, we could
easily fancy ourselves in the valley of the Euphrates or in the plains
of Babylon, as described by Herodotus and Xenophon. And, without any
effort of the imagination, we could descry, in a palm-shaded village in
the vista before us, Jericho, as Moses saw it, when the Land of Promise
was a land of palms, as well as a land of milk and honey, and when
Judea was so prolific in palms that one of its representatives was
chosen as the symbol of the country.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e7997src" href="#xd21e7997" name="xd21e7997src">24</a> We dreamed
of Zenobia&rsquo;s fair capital, Palmyra&mdash;the city of
Palms&mdash;of the land of the Nile, where Isis and Osiris carried
palms as the symbol of their fecund power. We recalled the enthusiastic
words of the ancient poets&mdash;Hebrew and Greek&mdash;in praise of
the gracefulness and magnificence of the palm, and the plaintive elegy
of Abdul Rhaman, first calif of Cordoba, who, exiled from Damascus, his
home, thus addresses the date palm, that reminds him of the land of his
birth: &ldquo;Thou, also, beautiful palm, art here a stranger. The
sweet zephyr of Algaraba descends and caresses thy beauty. Thou growest
in this fertile soil and raisest thy crown to the skies. What bitter
tears thou would&rsquo;st shed, if, like me, thou hadst
feeling!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8000src" href="#xd21e8000"
name="xd21e8000src">25</a></p>
<p>While thus musing on the glories of the past and contemplating the
splendors of the present, which were passing in rapid succession before
our enchanted vision, we instinctively repeated the words of the
reverent poet-naturalist, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href=
"#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>Martius, who, contemplating the
marvels of the tropical palm-world, expressed the depth of his emotion
by the two words, <i>Sursum corda</i>&mdash;hearts heavenward!</p>
<p>Just then our reveries were suddenly and unexpectedly
interrupted.</p>
<p>We had, early in the day, been congratulating ourselves on making
our voyage down the river without delay and without accident. We were
now within sight of Barranquilla and expected to land in less than an
hour. We were in the full enjoyment of one of those delightful
day-dreams that we always loved to indulge in, whenever Flora displayed
before us, as she did then, her choicest treasures, when suddenly,
without premonition of any kind, there was a violent lurch of the boat,
a creaking and a crushing noise abaft, a quick stoppage of the engine,
all of which indicated that something unusual, if not serious, had
befallen our ill-fated craft. A hasty examination showed that the
steamer had collided with a sunken tree, and that several of the
float-boards of the stern-wheel had been loosened, or partially
wrenched from their places. After considerable delay the boatmen were
able so to repair the damage that we were able to continue on our
journey, although at a reduced speed.</p>
<p>Very shortly afterwards there was a second and a much severer crash.
We had encountered another hidden tree. This time several of the
float-boards were carried away from the wheel entirely, and the wheel
itself was so racked that repair, while on the river, was quite
impossible. Fortunately, as we were going down stream, we were able to
float to the entrance of the canal that leads to the docks of
Barranquilla. Here a crowd of stevedores from the town soon
congregated. These men, mostly negroes, agreed, after some parleying,
to haul the boat to the landing place. They, accordingly, took hold of
a long rope, which was thrown ashore, and soon the disabled steamer was

that interesting type of negro known as the <i>boga</i>. The boga is
tall and robust, with the habits of a savage. He spends the greater
part of his time in the champan, and his life as a punter is a
strenuous one and full of danger. He speaks a barbarous
jargon&mdash;<i>currulao</i>&mdash;composed of Spanish and of certain
African and Indian dialects. His ideas of honor and honesty are not
unlike those of similar people in other parts of the world. One can
safely trust him with money and clothing, but, if the traveler have
liquor of any kind with him, the boga will be sure to purloin it at the
first opportunity. He is simple, frank, and brave. He sings during good
weather, even while struggling against the current or fighting caymans,
but he swears like a trooper during rain and thunder storms, especially
when the lightning strikes near him. For him death is a very simple
matter. A dead man to him is like a champan damaged beyond

<p class="first">Barranquilla, a city of about sixty-five thousand
inhabitants, is notable for being the chief port of entry of Colombia.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the commerce of the republic
converges at this point. To us, coming from the interior of the
country, where comparatively little business is transacted, the place
seemed to be a marvel of activity and business enterprise. It counts a
large number of important business houses, the chief of which are
controlled by foreigners. It is provided with tram-ways, electric
lights, telephones, a good water supply and, in many respects, reminds
one of our progressive cities on the Gulf Coast. Many of the private
residences, especially in the more elevated quarters of the city, are
models of comfort and good taste. The average annual temperature is
80&deg; F., but the refreshing breezes from the Caribbean make it seem
less. At no time during our sojourn of more than a week in the city,
had we reason to complain of the excessive heat of which so much has
been said and written. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href=
"#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span></p>
<p>Although Barranquilla was founded in 1629, it is only within the
last third of a century that it has come to the front as the leading
entrepot of the republic. Before this time, Cartagena and Santa Marta
were Colombia&rsquo;s principal ports and busiest marts. This change in
the relative importance of these three ports was effected by the
construction of a great pier at Savanilla and connecting it with
Barranquilla by rail. After this both Cartagena and Santa Marta rapidly
dwindled in importance as distributing centres, while the growth of
Barranquilla was correspondingly rapid. Were it not for the banana
industry, controlled by the United Fruit Company, an American
corporation, Santa Marta&rsquo;s trade would now be little more than
nominal.</p>
<p>But why, it will be asked, do not ocean vessels dock at Barranquilla
instead of unloading so far away from the city? The usual answer given,
and in a way the correct one, is that the Magdalena is not deep enough
to permit the passage of so large vessels. We saw one venturesome ocean
liner stranded near the mouth of the river on a sand bar, where it had
been washed and pounded for nearly two years. Many attempts had been
made to float her but without success, and it seemed as if she was
destined to remain a captive of the treacherous shoal that had so long
held her in its unyielding grasp. The real reason, however, for not
having the landing place where it should be&mdash;in the city
itself&mdash;is the lack of the capital that would be required to
dredge the river, and enlarge the canal, and keep them both in a
condition that would insure the safe passage of vessels of heavy draft.
Given an engineer like James B. Eades, of Mississippi jetties fame, and
the necessary capital, the improvement would soon be effected.</p>
<p>Before leaving Bogot&aacute; we had planned to reach Barranquilla in
time to take an English steamer from Savanilla&mdash;Puerto
Colombia&mdash;to Colon. We then flattered ourselves that, after
reaching the mouth of the Magdalena, we should have no difficulty in
making connection for any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href=
"#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>part of the world, and that delay
in continuing our journey was the last thing to be apprehended.</p>
<p>But alas and alack! Where we least expected it, we were doomed to
disappointment. We had crossed the continent without a single failure
to connect, as we had anticipated, except at Barrig&oacute;n, where we
were detained a day, and had not experienced a single disagreeable
delay, and now, when we had reached the world lines of travel, we were
informed that the steamer we had intended to take had been laid up for
repairs, and that we should be obliged to wait a week before another
would arrive.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but resign ourselves to the inevitable.
Barranquilla is not a place where a traveler would care to remain long
as a matter of choice, but we managed to make ourselves comfortable.
The time passed more quickly and pleasantly than we anticipated, but,
just as we began to make preparations for our departure, we found
ourselves the victims of a new disappointment. The steamer that we were
to take was forbidden to land at Savanilla, in consequence of having
stopped at Trinidad, which was then reported to be infected by the
bubonic plague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; we said, &ldquo;we are getting into the region
of <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>&mdash;delay and disappointment&mdash;just at
the moment when we thought we were leaving it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had been so fortunate thus far, and that too in lands where, we
had been assured, everything would be against us and where the
best-laid plans would be frustrated, that we were ill prepared for
delay where it was least expected. Happily for us, however, a steamer,
having a clean bill of health, but belonging to another line, was due
in a few days, and this we determined to take, for we did not know when
we should be able to get another one. When once the plague appears in
the West Indies, or on the mainland bordering the Caribbean, quarantine
regulations are strictly enforced, and the luckless traveler may find
himself a prisoner for weeks, and even months, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>in a
place that is practically destitute of the commonest comforts and
conveniences of life. Then, indeed, his lot&mdash;especially if he is
not familiar with the language of the country&mdash;is far from
enviable. I have met with many people who, under such untoward
conditions, had to endure the greatest privations and sufferings.</p>
<p>By the greatest good fortune, it seemed to us, we finally got aboard
a good, comfortable vessel. It was not, however, bound for our
objective point&mdash;Colon&mdash;but for Puerto Limon, in Costa Rica.
This, although we did not know it at the time, was a blessing in
disguise. Had we gone directly to Colon, we should have been obliged to
spend some time in quarantine. By going to Costa Rica, we escaped this
and were able, during a week, to combine <i lang="it">utile
dulci</i>&mdash;study with pleasure&mdash;under the most favorable and
delightful circumstances.</p>
<p>From Puerto Colombia we went directly to Cartagena&mdash;a city
that, in some respects, possessed a greater interest for us than any we
had hitherto visited in South America. We entered this famous harbor,
large enough to hold all the navies of the world, early in the morning,
just as the sun was beginning to impart a subdued roseate glow to the
tiled roofs of the loftier buildings of the once flourishing metropolis
of New Granada.</p>
<p>The picture of Cartagena, as it first presented itself to our view,
was one of rarest loveliness. As we then saw it, it was not unlike
Venice as seen from Il Lido or from the deck of a steamer arriving from
Trieste. From another point as we advanced into the placid bay, we
discerned in it a resemblance to Alexandria, as viewed from the
Mediterranean. As Venice has been called the Queen of the Adriatic, so
also, and justly, did the beauteous city of Pedro de Heredia long bear
the proud title of <i lang="es">Reina de las Indias y Reina de los
Mares</i>, Queen of the Indies and Queen of the Seas.</p>
<p>One of the first cities built on Tierra Firme, it was also, for a
long period, one of the most important places in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>the
New World. Its fortifications and the massive walls that girdle it have
long been celebrated. Even now these are the features that have the
greatest attraction for the visitor. Stupendous is the only word that
adequately characterizes them. Their immensity impresses one like the
pyramids of Ghizeh, and this impression is fully confirmed when one
learns their cost and the number of men engaged in their construction.
It is said that from thirty to one hundred thousand men were employed
on this titanic undertaking, and that it cost no less than fifty-nine
million dollars&mdash;a fabulous sum for that period. This reminds one
of what historians relate regarding the building of the pyramid of
Cheops, the greatest and most enduring of human monuments, as the walls
of Cartagena are the grandest and most imposing evidence of Spanish
power in the western hemisphere. So great was the draft made on the
royal exchequer by the construction of these massive walls that Philip
II, so the story runs, one day seized a field glass and looking in the
direction of Cartagena, murmured with disenchanted irony: &ldquo;Can
one see those walls? They must be very high, for the price
paid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No wonder that Charles V was always in need of money, and that, to
secure it, he was forced to mortgage a large tract of land in Venezuela
to the Welsers, the German bankers of Augsburg. No wonder that Philip
II, despite the stream of gold and silver that flowed into his coffers
from his vast possessions beyond the sea, was, during the second half
of his reign, forced to see his royal signature dishonored by bankers
who refused him further credit!</p>
<p>Cartagena in Colombia was named after Cartagena in Spain, as the
Spanish city, founded by Hasdrubal as an outpost to serve in future
Punic campaigns, was named from the celebrated Tyrian emporium that was
so long the rival of Rome. And when the sons of the Caribbean Carthage
sailed up the Cauca to establish new colonies and extend the sphere of
Spanish influence and enterprise, they commemorated their triumph, and
exhibited their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382"
name="pb382">382</a>]</span>loyalty to the land of their birth, by
founding still another Carthage&mdash;the Cartago of the Upper
Cauca.</p>
<p>And what an eventful story is that of the Caribbean Cartagena! What
changes has she not witnessed! What fortunes of war has she not
experienced! What disasters has she not suffered! Like her African
prototype, whose very strength caused her rival on the Tiber to decree
her downfall, Cartagena seemed to be singled out for attack by all the
enemies of Spain for long generations. Her cyclopean walls, that seemed
to render her impregnable, did not save her. Time and again she was
assaulted by pirates and buccaneers, who levied heavy tributes and
carried off booty of inestimable value. Drake, Morgan, Pointis<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8125src" href="#xd21e8125" name="xd21e8125src">1</a>
and Vernon attacked and ravaged her in turn, but unlike the Carthage of
the hapless Dido, she still survives. And notwithstanding the four long
sieges she sustained and the vicissitudes through which she passed
during the protracted War of Independence, when she was hailed as <i>La
Ciudad Heroica</i>&mdash;The heroic city&mdash;her walls, after three
and a half centuries, are still in a marvelous state of preservation
and evoke the admiration of all who behold them.</p>
<p>Everywhere within the city, which during colonial times enjoyed the
monopoly of commerce with Spain, are evidences of departed grandeur.
Churches, and palaces and monastic institutions, beautiful and
grandiose, still retain much of the glamour of days long past. In the
charming plazas, shaded by graceful palms and adorned with richest
tropical verdure and bloom; along the narrow streets flanked by
spacious edifices and ornamented with multi-colored balconies and
curiously grated windows, one feels always under the spell of a proud
and romantic past, of an age of chivalry of which only the memory
remains. The architecture of many of the buildings, erstwhile homes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>of wealth and culture and refinement, is Moorish
in character and carried us back to many happy days spent in fair
Andalusia in its once noble capitals, Granada and Seville.</p>
<p>Strolling along the grass-grown pavements of Cartagena, we note in
the former flourishing metropolis what Wordsworth observed in
Bruge&rsquo;s town,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd21e2280">&ldquo;Many a street</p>
<p class="line">Whence busy life has fled.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But we also discern unmistakable signs of an awakening
to a new life, and of the dawn of a new era of prosperity and
mercantile greatness. Notwithstanding the venerable years in which she
is at present arrayed, we can, without being horoscopists, safely
presage that the benignant stars are sure to bring</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;What fate denies to man,&mdash;a second
spring.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To enjoy the best view of Cartagena, one must ascend
an eminence to the east of the city called La Popa, from its fancied
resemblance to the lofty stern of a fifteenth century ship. There,
seated under an umbrageous cocoa palm, fully five hundred feet above
the beautiful iris-blue bay that washes the walls that encircle the
city, one has before him one of the most charming panoramas in the
world; one which during more than three centuries, was the witness of
some of the most stirring events in history. In the broad, steep
harbor, protected on all sides by frowning fortresses, the Spanish
plate-fleets long found refuge from corsairs and sea rovers. It was
here, when pirates and buccaneers made it unsafe to transport treasure
by the Pacific, that gold and silver were brought from Bolivia to Peru,
Ecuador and New Granada by way of the Andean plateau and the Cauca and
Magdalena rivers.</p>
<p>One is stupefied when one considers what an expenditure of energy
this implied. Think of transporting gold and silver ingots a distance
of more than two thousand miles, over the arid deserts of Bolivia and
Peru, and across the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384"
name="pb384">384</a>]</span>chilly punas and paramos of the lofty
Cordilleras; of securing it against loss in passing along dizzy
ravines, across furious torrents, through the almost impenetrable
forests of New Granada, often infested by hostile Indians. And
remember, that, for a part of this long distance, these heavy burdens
had to be carried by human beings, for no other means of transportation
were available.</p>
<p>And when one considers the amount of the treasure thus transported
from points as distant as the flanks of Potosi and the auriferous
deposits of the distant Pilcomayo, the wonder grows apace. According to
the estimates of reliable historians, the amount of gold and silver
imported into Spain from her American possessions from 1502 to 1775 was
no less than the colossal sum of ten billion dollars.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e8156src" href="#xd21e8156" name="xd21e8156src">2</a> Nearly
two billions of this treasure were taken from the famous silver mines
of Potosi alone. The greater part of the bullion from Peru was shipped
by the South Sea to Panama and Nombre de Dios and thence carried to
Spain in carefully guarded plate-fleets. But after the pirates and
buccaneers became active along the western coast of South America, the
ingots of the precious metals, yielded by the mines between Chile and
the Caribbean were transported overland and deposited in carefully
guarded galleons awaiting them in the harbor of the Queen of the
Indies.</p>
<p>But even then the treasure was not safe. It was, indeed, much more
exposed on the way from Cartagena to Palos and Cadiz than it had been
from the time it had been dispatched from the smelter until its arrival
at the great stronghold on the Caribbean. For then, suddenly and
without warning, like a flock of vultures that had scented carrion from
afar, there gathered from all points of the compass English buccaneers,
French filibusters, and Dutch freebooters and harassed the galleons
until they succumbed. So successful did these daring sea robbers
eventually become <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385"
name="pb385">385</a>]</span>that no galleon dared to venture alone on
the waters of the Indian seas, and only strongly guarded plate-fleets
could hope to escape capture by their alert and venturesome enemies,
who swarmed over the Caribbean from the Lesser Antilles to Yucatan, and
terrorized the coast of the Spanish Main from one end to the other.</p>
<p>One loves to conjecture what might have been if Charles V or Philip
II had been endowed with the genius of a Napoleon or a C&aelig;sar.
Masters of the greater part of Europe, and undisputed sovereigns of the
major portion of the Western Hemisphere, with untold wealth continually
pouring into their treasury, then was the time&mdash;the only time,
probably, in the history of the modern world&mdash;to realize
Dante&rsquo;s fond dream of a universal monarchy. But neither Charles
nor Philip had the genius required, and the one opportunity, that ever
presented itself, of making Spanish possessions coextensive with the
world&rsquo;s surface, was lost and lost forever.</p>
<p>The sun was rapidly approaching the western horizon when we took our
departure from the beautiful and picturesque harbor of the Queen of the
Seas. In a short time the coast of what was once known as Castilla del
Oro&mdash;Golden Castile&mdash;had disappeared from our view and the
prow of our vessel was directed towards the historic land of Costa
Rica&mdash;the Rich Coast&mdash;discovered by Columbus during his
fourth voyage.</p>
<p>The night following our visit to Cartagena was an ideal one, a night
for wakeful dreams and the sweet delights of reverie. There was
scarcely a ripple on the waters, and the stars of the firmament seemed
to shine with an unwonted effulgence. All was peace and tranquillity,
and everything seemed to proclaim the joy of living.</p>
<p>How different was old Benzoni&rsquo;s experience in these same
waters and during the same season of the year! &ldquo;In consequence of
contrary winds,&rdquo; he tells us, &ldquo;we remained there
seventy-two days, and in all this time we did not see four hours of
sunshine. Almost constantly and especially <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>at
night, there was so much heavy rain, and thunder and lightning, that it
seemed as if both heaven and earth would be destroyed.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8176src" href="#xd21e8176" name=
"xd21e8176src">3</a></p>
<p>The experience of Columbus was even more terrifying. In a letter to
Ferdinand and Isabella, giving an account of his fourth voyage, the
great navigator informs them that, so great was the force of wind and
current, he was able to advance only seventy leagues in sixty days.
During this time, there was no &ldquo;cessation of the tempest, which
was one continuation of rain, thunder and lightning; indeed, it seemed
as if it were the end of the world.... Eighty-eight days did this
fearful tempest continue, during which I was at sea, and saw neither
sun nor stars.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8183src" href=
"#xd21e8183" name="xd21e8183src">4</a> The name Cape <i lang=
"es">Gracias &aacute; Dios</i>&mdash;Thanks be to God&mdash;which he
gave to the easternmost point of Nicaragua and Honduras, still remains
to attest his gratitude for his miraculous escape from what for many
long weeks seemed certain destruction.</p>
<p>It was our good fortune, during all our cruising in the Caribbean,
to enjoy the most delightful weather, but we never appreciated it so
much as we did during our voyage from Cartagena to Puerto Limon, and
more especially during the first night after our departure from the
Colombian coast. We were then sailing in waters that had been rendered
famous by the achievements of some of the most remarkable men named in
the annals of early American discovery and conquest, where every green
island and silent bay, every barren rock and sandy key, has its legend,
and where, at every turn, one breathes an atmosphere of romance and
wonderland.</p>
<p>At one time we were following in the wake of the illustrious Admiral
of the Ocean; at another we were in the track of Amerigo Vespucci and
Juan de la Cosa, that brave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href=
"#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>Biscayan pilot who was regarded by
his companions as an oracle of the sea. Rodrigo de Bastidas, Alonso de
Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa passed this way, as did Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez
de Balboa, the discoverer of the Great South Sea, who, his countrymen
declared, never knew when he was beaten, and who, according to Fiske,
was &ldquo;by far the most attractive figure among the Spanish
adventurers of that time.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8198src"
href="#xd21e8198" name="xd21e8198src">5</a> The Pizarros and Almagro
sailed these waters, before embarking at Panama on that marvelous
expedition which resulted in the conquest of Peru. And so did Orellana,
the discoverer of the Amazon, and Belalcazar, the noted conquistador
and rival of Quesada and Federmann. And then, too, there was Gonzalez
Davila, the explorer of Nicaragua, and Hernando Cortes, the
<span class="corr" id="xd21e8203" title=
"Source: conquerer">conqueror</span> of Mexico.</p>
<p>And last, but the best and noblest of them all, was the gentle and
indefatigable Las Casas, the protector of the aborigines and the
Apostle of the Indies, whose memory is still held in benediction in all
Latin America. His voluminous writings, making more than ten thousand
pages octavo, much of which is devoted to the defense of the Indians,
constitute a monument which will endure as long as men shall love truth
and justice. But his greatest monument&mdash;one that is absolutely
unique in the history of civilization&mdash;is his former diocese of
Chiapa, which is just northwest of the land towards which we are
sailing. When he went to take possession of it, it was occupied by
savage warriors who had successfully resisted all attempts made by the
Spaniards to subdue them. It was considered tantamount to certain death
to enter their jealously-guarded territory. But Las Casas, armed only
with the image of the Crucified and the gospel of peace, soon had these
wild children of the forest prostrate at his feet, begging him to
remain with them as their father and friend. So successful was his work
among them that the land which, before his arrival, had been known as
La <i>Provincia de Guerra</i>&mdash;The Province of War&mdash;was
thereafter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>called <i lang="es">La Provincia de Vera
Paz</i>&mdash;The Province of True Peace&mdash;a name it bears to the
present day. And more remarkable still, this particular part of
Guatemala is said to have a denser Indian population, in proportion to
its area, than any other part of Latin America. Truly, this is a
monument worthy of the name, and one that would have appealed most
strongly to the loving heart of the courageous protector of the
Indians.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8216src" href="#xd21e8216" name=
"xd21e8216src">6</a></p>
<p>But discoverers and explorers, conquistadores and apostles, were not
the only men who have rendered this part of the world forever
memorable. There were others, but many of them were of a vastly
different type. I refer to the pirates and Buccaneers, who so long
spread terror in these parts and ultimately destroyed the commercial
supremacy of Spain in the New World, and contributed so materially to
the final extinction of her sovereign power. Many of them have written
their names large on the scroll of history and often in characters of
blood. Many of them were pirates of the worst type, who flew at every
flag they saw, who recognized no right but might, and whose sole object
was indiscriminate robbery on both sea and land. These outlaws,
however, have no interest for us now.</p>
<p>Besides these unscrupulous and sanguinary pirates, there was another
class of men whom their friends and countrymen insist on grouping in a
class by themselves. The majority of these were Englishmen, of whom the
most distinguished representatives, along the Spanish Main, were
Raleigh, Hawkins and Drake. When these men did not act <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>under secret commissions from their government,
they relied on its tacit connivance in all the depredations for which
they are so notorious. In the light of international law, as we now
understand it, they were as much pirates as those who attacked the
ships of all nations, and as such they have always been regarded by
Spanish writers. All three of the men just mentioned made their raids
on Spanish possessions while England was at peace with Spain. Thus the
two nations were at peace when Drake sacked Panama in 1586, as they
were at peace when Raleigh attacked Trinidad in 1595. These sea rovers
lived up to the old forecastle phrase, &ldquo;No peace beyond the
line&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8228src" href="#xd21e8228" name=
"xd21e8228src">7</a> and recognized, at least in the Spanish territory
in the New World, no law of nations except that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;They should take who have the power,</p>
<p class="line">And they should keep who can.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;The case,&rdquo; as old Fuller quaintly puts it
in his <i>Holy and Profane State</i>, &ldquo;was clear in sea-divinity;
and few are such infidels as not to believe doctrines which make for
their own profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far as England acquiesced in, or connived at what the Spaniards
always denounced as downright piracy, it was doubtless ever with the
view of weakening the menacing power of the dominant Spanish empire.
She was also actuated by &ldquo;an aggressive determination to break
down the barriers with which Spanish policy sought to enclose the New
World and to shut out the way to the Indies.&rdquo; In this
determination England had the sympathy of France and often its active
co&ouml;peration. For a similar reason Dutch sea rovers swarmed over
the Caribbean Sea. All were aware of the magnitude of the struggle in
which they were engaged, and realized that their existence as nations
depended on their crippling their common enemy by striking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>at
the sources of his power in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Much might be said of the reckless audacity, brilliant achievements
and skillful seamanship of these privateers or pirates&mdash;whatever
one chooses to call them&mdash;that read more like fable or romance
than sober chronicles of authentic fact, but space does not permit.
Besides, we are more interested in another class of sea rovers of a
later date, whose names and exploits are inseparably connected with the
West Indies and the great South Sea. I refer to the Buccaneers, or, as
they called themselves, the Brethren of the Coast.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of these extraordinary adventurers is derived mainly
from themselves. Of English Buccaneers the most interesting narratives
have been left us by Sharp, Cowley, Ringrose and Dampier. The
Frenchman, Ravenau de Lussan, has also left us a record of value. The
most popular work, however, and the one that gives us the truest
insight into the manners and customs of the Brethren of the Coast, and
recounts with the greatest detail their deeds of daring and cruelty, is
that given to the world by the Dutchman Esquemeling. It was entitled
<i lang="nl">De Americaensche Zee Rovers</i> and was, on its
appearance, immediately translated into the principal languages of
Europe. The fact that Esquemeling was with the Buccaneers for five
years, and was with them, too, on many of their most important
expeditions, gave him unusual opportunities for collecting facts at
first hand and studying the methods of procedure of his reckless and
often brutal associates.</p>
<p>By the Spaniards, the Brethren of the Coast have always been
regarded as pirates&mdash;for the same reason as Raleigh, Drake and
Hawkins and their associates were regarded as pirates&mdash;because
they conducted their lawless operations when England and Spain were at
peace. But there was the same difference between Buccaneers and
ordinary pirates as there was between the corsairs just mentioned and
ordinary pirates. The latter attacked vessels of every nation, while
the Buccaneers, like Drake and his compatriots, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>confined themselves to preying on Spanish
shipping and sacking Spanish towns and strongholds.</p>
<p>Some became Buccaneers because they had a grievance, real or
imaginary, against the Spaniards, others because they chafed under the
monopolizing policy of the Spanish government, and wished to secure a
part of the ever-increasing trade with the New World, while others
still joined the ranks of the Brethren because they relished the life
of excitement and adventure it held forth, or because they found it the
easiest means of gaining a livelihood.</p>
<p>Esquemeling was among the last of these classes. After being twice
sold as a slave, he finally obtained his liberty when, to use his own
words, &ldquo;Though like Adam when he was first created, that is,
naked and destitute of all human necessaries, not knowing how to get my
living, I determined to enter into the Order of the Pyrates or Robbers
at Sea.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8261src" href="#xd21e8261"
name="xd21e8261src">8</a></p>
<p>The cradle of the extraordinary &ldquo;Order of Pyrates,&rdquo; of
which Esquemeling was to be the most distinguished chronicler, was
Tortuga, a small, rocky island off the northwest corner of Haiti. It
was visited by Columbus during his first voyage, and, from the number
of turtles found there, was called Tortuga&mdash;the Spanish for
turtle&mdash;the name it still retains. But small as it was, it was
destined to become &ldquo;the common refuge of all sorts of wickedness,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>and the seminary, as it were of pyrates and
thieves.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8273src" href="#xd21e8273"
name="xd21e8273src">9</a></p>
<p>The name Buccaneer is derived from &ldquo;bucan,&rdquo; a Carib word
signifying a wooden gridiron on which meat is smoked. Originally, the
term Buccaneer was applied to the French settlers of Espa&ntilde;ola,
whose chief occupation was to hunt wild cattle and hogs, which roamed
over the island in large numbers, and cure their flesh by bucaning it,
that is smoking it on a bucan.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8284src"
href="#xd21e8284" name="xd21e8284src">10</a> When they were driven from
their business of bucaning by the Spaniards, they took refuge in
Tortuga, where they were soon joined by many English adventurers. Here
they combined to make war on Spain in her American colonies, and for
more than a half century they carried terror and destruction to every
part of the Caribbean archipelago.</p>
<p>But, notwithstanding their change of occupation, their old name of
Buccaneer clung to them, and, as such, they are still known in history.
Like the bold Vikings of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href=
"#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>North, who were so long the
scourge of western and southern Europe, the Buccaneers were the scourge
of Spanish America from Tortuga to Panama and from California to
Patagonia. They warred against but one enemy&mdash;the one that had
harassed and driven them from their peaceful avocation of bucaning, or
had persecuted and oppressed their brethren in the peaceful pursuit of
commerce, when the lands of their birth, or the countries to which they
owed allegiance, were unable or unwilling to protect them.</p>
<p>Like the archpirate Drake, as the Spaniards called him, &ldquo;They
swept the sea of every passing victualler, and added the captured
cargoes to the stores of game and fish it was their delight to catch.
At intervals along the coast and amongst the wilderness of islands,
magazines were hidden, and into these were poured the stores that had
been destined for the great plate-fleets. The shark-like pinnaces would
suddenly appear in the midst of the trade-route no one knew whence, and
laden with food, as suddenly disappear no one knew whither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compared with the Spaniards, they were usually in a small minority.
But in their case, as in so many similar ones, it was not numbers, but
their skill and courage, that gave them possession of rich galleons and
placed the well-guarded plate-fleets at their mercy. At times the
Buccaneers had only simple canoes&mdash;mere dugouts&mdash;but these,
according to Esquemeling, were so fleet that they might well be called
&ldquo;Neptune&rsquo;s post-horses.&rdquo; In these they went out to
sea for a distance of eighty leagues and attacked heavily-armed men of
war, and, before the Spanish crew had time to realize what the daring
sea rovers were after, their vessel was in the possession of their
irresistible foe.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8295src" href="#xd21e8295"
name="xd21e8295src">11</a></p>
<p>They were strangers to fear, and no undertaking was too <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name=
"pb394">394</a>]</span>arduous, if the booty promised was sufficiently
great. Danger and difficulty seemed only to whet their appetite for
gold and fan their passions to a blaze. Their endurance of hunger and
thirst and fatigue was as remarkable as their hardihood was phenomenal.
They were loyal to one another and divided the spoils they secured in
strict accordance with the agreement they had entered into beforehand.
&ldquo;Locks and bolts were prohibited, as such things were regarded as
impeaching the honor of their vocation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were religious after their own fashion. Thus it was forbidden
to hunt or cure meat on Sunday. Before going on a cruise, they went to
church to ask a blessing on their undertaking, and, after a successful
raid, they returned to the house of God to sing a hymn of thanksgiving.
We are told of a French captain who shot a filibuster for irreverence
in church during divine service, and we also read of Captain Hawkins
once throwing dice overboard when he found them being used on the
Lord&rsquo;s day.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8304src" href="#xd21e8304"
name="xd21e8304src">12</a></p>
<p>How all this reminds one of the conduct of that pitiless old slaver,
John Hawkins, who frequently enjoined on his crew to &ldquo;serve God
daily,&rdquo; and who, after escaping a heavy gale on his way from
Africa to the West Indies, whither he was bound with a shipload of
kidnapped negroes, sanctimoniously writes, &ldquo;The Almighty God, who
never suffereth His elect to perish, sent us the ordinary
breeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the Buccaneers frequently came into possession of immense
sums of money, they would forthwith <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb395" href="#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>proceed to squander
it in all kinds of dissipation and debauchery. &ldquo;Such of these
pyrates,&rdquo; writes Esquemeling, &ldquo;will spend two or three
thousand pieces of eight in a night, not leaving themselves a good
shirt to wear in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, the Buccaneers confined themselves to depredations on sea,
but their unexpected successes on water soon emboldened them to attack
the largest and richest towns on the Spanish Main. When these were once
in their power, they exacted from their inhabitants a heavy tribute,
and if it was not paid without delay, the hapless people, regardless of
age or sex, were subjected to the most cruel and unheard-of tortures.
Puerto Principe, Maracaibo, Porto Bello, Panama and other places were
captured in turn, and some of them, when sufficient ransom was not
obtained, were burned to the ground. And so great and so hideous were
the atrocities committed in some of these places that even Esquemeling
has not the heart to do more than allude to them. They equaled, if they
did not surpass, anything recorded of the pirates of Barbary or
Malabar, and showed what fiends incarnate men can become when carried
away by insatiate greed or the spirit of rapine and carnage.</p>
<p>The two Buccaneer leaders who most distinguished themselves for
their diabolical ferocity and viciousness were L&rsquo;Olonnois and
Morgan. &ldquo;L&rsquo;Olonnois,&rdquo; says Burney, &ldquo;was
possessed with an ambition to make himself renowned for being terrible.
At one time, it is said, he put the whole crew of a Spanish ship,
ninety men, to death, performing himself the office of executioner, by
beheading them. He caused the crews of four others vessels to be thrown
into the sea; and more than once, in his frenzies, he tore out the
hearts of his victims and devoured them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8321src" href="#xd21e8321" name="xd21e8321src">13</a></p>
<p>This &ldquo;infernal wretch,&rdquo; as Esquemeling calls him,
&ldquo;full of horrid, execrable and enormous deeds, and debtor to so
much innocent blood, died by cruel and butcherly hands,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>for the Indians of Darien, having taken him
prisoner, &ldquo;tore him in pieces alive, throwing his body, limb by
limb, into the fire, and his ashes into the air, that no trace or
memory might remain of such an infamous, inhuman
creature.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8330src" href="#xd21e8330"
name="xd21e8330src">14</a></p>
<p>Of Henry Morgan, who sacked Maracaibo and pillaged and burnt Panama,
the same authority declares he &ldquo;may deservedly be called the
second L&rsquo;Olonnois, not being unlike or inferior to him, either in
achievements against the Spaniards or robberies of many innocent
people.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8335src" href="#xd21e8335"
name="xd21e8335src">15</a></p>
<p>He did not, however, share the fate of L&rsquo;Olonnois. Having
found favor with King Charles II, he was knighted and made deputy
governor of Jamaica, when he turned against his former associates, many
of whom he hanged, while he delivered others up to their enemies, the
Spaniards.</p>
<p>From the time the Buccaneers made Tortuga a base of operations until
the Peace of Ryswick, in 1697, when they were finally suppressed, was
more than half a century. From this little island they spread over the
entire Caribbean sea and had places of rendezvous in Jamaica, Santa
Catalina, the sequestered coves of the Gulf of Darien and in many
secret places along the Spanish Main. Their distinctive mark during all
this time, from which they never deviated, as it had been the
distinctive mark of pirates and privateers of England, France and
Holland during nearly a century and a half before, was their incessant
and relentless war against Spain; their determination to break her
power and destroy that trade monopoly which she was so determined to
retain.</p>
<p>So numerous and powerful did they eventually become that some of
their leaders, notably Mansvelt and Morgan, dreamed of establishing an
independent state. They had selected the small island of Santa
Catalina&mdash;now known as Old Providence&mdash;just a short distance
north of the course along which we are now sailing&mdash;as a starting
point and, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>had they undertaken this project while the
French and English Buccaneers were still united, they might have been
successful.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8346src" href="#xd21e8346" name=
"xd21e8346src">16</a></p>
<p>To us of the twentieth century, with our ideas of law and order, it
seems strange that the pirates and Buccaneers of the West India islands
and the Main should have been able to continue their nefarious
operations for so long a period, and that they were so numerous. But,
when we remember how they were countenanced and abetted by their
respective governments, how they were provided with letters of marque

were assisted even by their own sovereigns,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8360src" href="#xd21e8360" name="xd21e8360src">18</a> the wonder
ceases. Considering the love of adventure that distinguished this
period of the world&rsquo;s history, and the princely fortunes that
rewarded the successful raids of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398"
href="#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>the daring sea rovers, it is
surprising that the number was not greater. If the same conditions now
obtained, it is safe to say that the seas would swarm with similar
adventurers. It is interesting to surmise what would now be the
condition of the Western Hemisphere if the Buccaneers, instead of
confining themselves to capturing treasure ships and sacking towns,
had, like the bold Vikings, their antitypes, set out to conquer and
colonize.</p>
<p>Whatever else may be said of the Buccaneers, there can be no doubt
that it is to them that England owes her proud title of Mistress of the
Seas. They gave birth to her great navy, and developed that great
merchant marine whose flags are to-day seen in every port of the world.
They distinguished themselves in the destruction of the Spanish Armada,
and closely followed Magellan in circumnavigating the globe. They had a
hand in the formation of the East India Company and were
&ldquo;Britain&rsquo;s sword and shield for the defence of her nascent
colonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the occupation of the Buccaneers one can assert what James
Jeffrey Roche writes of that of the filibusters of the middle of the
last century&mdash;that it &ldquo;is no longer open to private
individuals. The great powers have monopolized the business, conducting
it as such and stripping it of its last poor remnant of romance,
without investing it with a scrap of improved morality.&rdquo;<a class=

<p class="footnote">Esquemeling, as the reader will observe, does not
apply to his associates the euphemious term Buccaneers, but calls them
&ldquo;the Pyrates of America, which sort of men are not authorized by
any sovereign prince. For the Kings of Spain having on several
occasions sent their ambassadors to the Kings of England and France to
complain of the molestations and troubles those pyrates often caused on
the coasts of America, even in the calm of peace, it hath always been
answered that such men did not commit those acts of hostility and
pyracy as subjects to their Majesties, and therefore his Catholick
Majesty might proceed against them as he should think fit. The King of
France added that he had no fortress nor castle upon Hispaniola,
neither did he receive a farthing of tribute from thence. And the King
of England adjoined that he had never given any commission to those of
Jamaica to commit hostilities against the subjects of his Catholick

says Sir Frederick Treves, in his charming work. <i>The Cradle of the
Deep</i>, &ldquo;In defiance of the ban of Spain, a strange company
began to collect.... They came across the seas in obedience to no call;
in ones and twos they came. Frenchmen, British, and Dutch, and, led by
some herding instinct, they foregathered at this wild trysting-place.
Some were mere dare-devil adventurers, others were wily seekers after
fortune; the few were in flight from the grip of justice, the many had
roamed away from the old sober world in search of freedom.</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;There was a common tie that banded them
together, the call of the wild and the hate of Spain. They formed no
colony, nor settlement, but simply joined themselves together in a kind
of jungle brotherhood. They found a leader as a pack of wolves finds
theirs, not by choosing one to lead but by following the one who
led.&rdquo; P. 250, London, 1908.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

awhile the term Buccaneer was applied to the English, who had nothing
to do with the bucan, as well as to the French adventurers.
Subsequently the French sea-rovers became known as flibustiers, the
French sailors&rsquo; pronunciation of the word freebooter, while the
English corsairs appropriated the name Buccaneers. As their occupations
were the same&mdash;making war on the Spaniard&mdash;the two terms came
eventually to be regarded as synonymous. All the freebooters, whether
English, French, or Dutch, as an indication of their being banded
against a common enemy, the Spaniards, assumed the name Brethren of the
Coast. The members of this brotherhood must not be confounded with such
cutthroats as Kidd, Bonnet, Avery and Thatch, who was known as
Blackbeard and, for a while, terrorized the Atlantic Coast from the
West Indies to New England.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

the French Flibustier, Pierre le Grand, with only a small boat and a

Referring to this matter, George W. Thornsburg writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="footnote">&ldquo;Anomalous beings, hunters by land and sea,
scaring whole fleets with a few canoes, sacking cities with a few
grenadiers, devastating every coast from California to Cape Horn, they
needed only a common principle of union to have founded an aggressive
republic as wealthy as Venice and as warlike as Carthage. One great
mind and the New World had been their own.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Monarchs

Esquemeling tells us that Morgan&rsquo;s fleet, before his raid on
Maracaibo, was, by order of the governor of Jamaica, strengthened by
the addition of an English vessel of thirty-six guns. This was done to
give the ruthless Buccaneer &ldquo;greater courage to attempt mighty
things.&rdquo; Op. cit., p. 147.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Spaniards accused Queen Elizabeth of aiding Drake, and it is known that
she lent John Hawkins one of her ships. &ldquo;The great Queen,&rdquo;
as Mowbray Morris observes, &ldquo;had a most convenient way of
publically deprecating the riotous acts of her subjects, when she found
it expedient to do so, and roundly encouraging them in private. She was
fond of money, too, and ... had found a share in these ventures
uncommonly remunerative. Unqueenly tricks, as they seem to us, and apt
to confuse the law of nations, they were, as things went then,
extremely useful to England.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Tales of the Spanish

<p class="first">The afternoon preceding our arrival at Puerto Limon,
the captain of our steamer called our attention to a wonderful mirage
due south of us. High above the water&mdash;apparently midway between
the sea and the sky&mdash;was suspended one of the islands of the
Caribbean that stand off from the Panama coast. So far away was it from
our course that, had it not been for the peculiar atmospheric
conditions then prevailing, it would have been quite invisible, even
with the aid of the most powerful glass. A beautiful, fantastic shape
it exhibited as, seen through the trembling and shimmering air, it
seemed to float in the hazy atmosphere. At first it was of a
pearly-gray tint, then of a fustian-brown, and finally, as it became
more distinct in outline, it shaded into a dark olive green. The
apparition lasted for nearly an hour, when it gradually
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vanishing Island of St. Brendan,&rdquo; exclaimed a young
Celt who had been admiring the scene. And then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>he
read for us what John Sparke, a companion of Hawkins in the voyage of
1564, writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certaine flitting ilands, which haue beene oftentimes seene,
and when men approched neere them they vanished, ... and therefore it
should seeme hee is not yet borne to whom God hath appoynted the
finding of them.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8434src" href=
"#xd21e8434" name="xd21e8434src">1</a></p>
<p>The flitting islands that Sparke refers to were, it is true,
supposed by him to be in the neighborhood of the Azores. But their
location was uncertain, at least the one named after the seafaring
Irish monk, for divers positions have been assigned it by cosmographers
and medi&aelig;val writers. Among other peculiarities possessed by this
island was that it had an apparent motion towards the west&mdash;a
motion that was quite sufficient to have carried it at the beginning of
the twentieth century to the westernmost part of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this motion westward,&rdquo; said C.&mdash;as our
representative of classical lore&mdash;&ldquo;the Island of St. Brendan
would have but followed the example set by the Elysian Fields and the
Isles of the Blessed. Pindar and Hesiod placed them in the Western
Ocean, but much farther west than Homer had located his Elysium. As the
years rolled by, the Fortunate Islands and the Gardens of the
Hesperides, for these were but synonyms of the Isles of the Blessed,
were also found, like St. Brendan&rsquo;s, to have moved towards the
region of the setting sun. Subsequently, birth was given to legends
respecting a Transatlantic Eden and a Mexican Elysium somewhere in the
Gulf of Mexico or among the beauteous isles of the Caribbean
Archipelago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, very true,&rdquo; said one of our party, a
good-natured German privat-docent, who was perched hard by on what
seemed to be the first reclining chair ever devised. It was a
cumbersome structure about four feet high, apparently modeled after one
of those lofty bedsteads once the vogue in certain parts of the
Vaterland, and vastly different from the modern reclining chair so
popular with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>ocean travelers, and so rickety that it
threatened every moment to collapse and deposit its portly
occupant&mdash;for he was a man of weight, physically as well as
intellectually&mdash;on the hard floor of the hurricane deck.
&ldquo;You are quite right, Sr. C. The Isles of the Blessed, like the
Island of St. Brendan, are quite as ubiquitous and elusory as is the
Terrestrial Paradise described in Genesis. For learned men who have
written about it have located it, at one time or another, in almost
every part of the earth&rsquo;s surface. Some maintain it was somewhere
in the valley of Mesopotamia, others that it was east of the Ganges, or
near the head waters of the Nile. Columbus imagined it was nigh the
source of the Orinoco, while an American author&mdash;a Bostonian, I
believe&mdash;some decades ago published a work in which he endeavoured
to prove that the seat of Paradise was the North Pole. As for myself, I
have never ventured to formulate a theory on any of these interesting
subjects. They are out of my line. <i lang="la">Davus sum non
&OElig;dipus.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there was a crash. Like the &ldquo;wonderful one-hoss
shay,&rdquo; the tottering old chair had collapsed and the docent lay
sprawling under the ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Caramba, donnerwetter!</i>&rdquo; These two exclamations,
so dear to the Spaniard and the German, when they wish to express
surprise and disgust, were emitted with an explosive violence that left
no one present in doubt as to what thoughts were uppermost in the mind
of our friend as he was endeavoring to extricate himself from the
entangling frame. With the aid of some of the bystanders he finally
regained his feet, but he manifested no desire to continue the
conversation so suddenly interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Carajo, donnerblitz!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;two expressions even
more vigorous than the preceding&mdash;constituted the finale to the
performance that afforded amusement to all except the leading
character, who disliked exceedingly the undignified position in which
he had momentarily been placed. Fortunately, the last call for dinner
had been given just a few moments previously, and we accordingly
adjourned to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402"
name="pb402">402</a>]</span>dining saloon, where other matters absorbed
the attention of the unlucky docent as well as the spectators of his
ungainly tumble.</p>
<p>The morning following the little episode just referred to, we were
in sight of Costa Rica<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8468src" href=
"#xd21e8468" name="xd21e8468src">2</a>&mdash;that rich
coast&mdash;discovered by Columbus during his eventful fourth voyage.
The wooded lowlands, bordering the sea, are clothed in a mantle of rich
tropical verdure. A short distance behind them arise the escarpments of
the Central American Cordillera, that is the scene of the activity of
such noted volcanoes as Poas, Irazu and Turialba. Owing to the
proximity of the Sierra to the sea, it appears much higher than it
really is, and, when the weather is clear, it presents a picture of
rare magnificence. This is particularly the case when it is seen at
sunrise, the time it first met our view. Then we had before us the
violet expanse of the summer sea canopied by the splendid azure vault
of heaven, while before us stood up in all its majesty the gentian blue
peak of the Cordillera that gradually melted into crimson and then into
gold.</p>
<p>Owing to the reports that had been received at Limon regarding the
plague at Trinidad, and the fear that it might already have reached the
Spanish Main, none of the passengers were allowed to land until they
had passed, on the part of the health officers, an examination of more
than usual strictness. Fortunately, we had provided ourselves with a
health certificate before leaving Barranquilla and were permitted to
land after but little delay. Those, however, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>who
could not exhibit such a document were at once ordered off to
quarantine. Everyone, however, had to be vaccinated, unless one could
produce evidence that he had been vaccinated only a short time before.
As very few could present such evidence, the great majority had to
submit&mdash;many of them much against their will&mdash;to being
inoculated with the virus that is supposed to render one immune against
smallpox.</p>
<p>While these operations were going on, we had an opportunity of
getting a good view of the coast in front of us. It had a special
interest for us, for it was the favored land along which Columbus
sailed in his last voyage in 1502. Here, before us, there is reason to
believe, was the land of Cariari, and, just a stone&rsquo;s throw from
our steamer was the charming island of Quiribri, which, on account of
its beauty and the lovely trees with which it was adorned&mdash;palms
and bananas and platanos&mdash;the Admiral called El Huerto&mdash;the
orchard. To-day it is known as the island of Uvita, and is used for
quarantine. As we gazed on this exquisite spot, provided with cozy
cottages nestling among clumps of stately palms, and decked with
beauteous flowers of every hue, we almost regretted that we could not
spend a few days there. Had we been sent there with the others we
should certainly not have complained.</p>
<p>So fascinating was this place that Columbus anchored here between
the island and the mainland to give his crew an opportunity to refresh
themselves after their arduous voyage. And so fragrant were the groves
on the mainland that their perfumes were wafted out to the ships. This,
we have noted, was also the experience of the early explorers of
Florida.</p>
<p>While here, Columbus held frequent converse with the Indians, whom
he found intelligent and well disposed. They brought him gifts of
cotton, cloth and gold and evidently were inclined to enter into
friendly relations with their strange visitors. In his letter to
Ferdinand and Isabella, referring to this land, he writes: &ldquo;There
I saw <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>a tomb in the mountain side as large as a house,
and sculptured.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8486src" href="#xd21e8486"
name="xd21e8486src">3</a> This is remarkable as being the only passage
in all the Admiral&rsquo;s writings which could warrant us in
concluding that he ever set foot on the mainland of the New World.</p>
<p>Until the middle of the last century Port Limon was but a small
<i>rancheria</i>&mdash;it did not deserve the name of village&mdash;of
poor fishermen. Now it is the chief port of the republic and a
flourishing town of 6,000 inhabitants. Its present importance and
prosperity are due to the completion of the railroad from this point to
the capital, San Jos&eacute;, and to the fact that it is the principal
centre of the rapidly-increasing banana industry controlled by the
United Fruit Company.</p>
<p>The place is quite modern in appearance, and were it not for its
exuberant tropical vegetation, might easily pass for one of our
enterprising Gulf Coast towns. It boasts of all modern improvements,
has good sanitation, broad streets, comfortable homes and a delightful
park that, for wealth and variety of tree and shrub and flower, looks
like a well-kept botanic garden. While the white race is well
represented, the majority of the population is made up of West Indian
negroes.</p>
<p>During our travels among the Antilles and on the Spanish Main, we
frequently had occasion to note the importance of the banana and the
platano as articles of food, but it was not until our arrival in Limon
that we had an opportunity of observing the extent to which the
cultivation and shipment of these fruits have been carried. Here are
two long iron piers at which one will occasionally find as many as six
or eight large steamers being freighted at the same time with the
golden fruit of Costa Rica, preparatory to distribution among the
leading ports along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.</p>
<p>The culture of the banana in Costa Rica on an extensive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>scale is of recent date. In 1880 but three
hundred and sixty bunches were sent to the United States. Now the
amount shipped from Limon alone averages more than a million bunches a
month. During the year 1908 the number of bunches that left Port Limon
aggregated more than thirteen million, and the amount shipped is
rapidly increasing. In addition to the daily shipments made to the

<p>But great as are the proportions which the banana trade has already
assumed, it is safe to say that it is as yet but in its infancy. What
in most parts of our country and Europe has hitherto been practically
unknown, or been regarded as a luxury beyond the reach of the poor, is
now rapidly finding its way among all classes and at such prices that
even those of the most limited means can have it on their tables.</p>
<p>That which first impresses the visitor from the North is the large
number of species of the <i>Musa</i> and the extraordinary number of
uses made of them. Already fully forty species have been described and
nearly a hundred varieties. Most of these bear fruit which is as
agreeable as it is nutritious, and which is often of a flavor of the
utmost delicacy.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made in a previous chapter to the
extensive and varied use made of bananas and platanos by the peoples of
tropical climes, but even they have still much to learn regarding the
food value of their great staple. Recent investigations have revealed
the fact that the fruit of the <i>Musa</i> is henceforth to be regarded
not only as one of the most wholesome and nutritious of foods, but also
as one of the most important means of subsistence for the world&rsquo;s
rapidly increasing population. Even now it is felt that the supply of
flesh meat and cereals is rapidly becoming less than the demand, and
too expensive for the poor, and thoughtful men have already set to work
to devise ways and means to meet the emergency. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span>And
one of the means suggested is a more extensive cultivation of platanos
and bananas, as well as a more general use of their manifold
products.</p>
<p>Humboldt long ago pointed out the great economic value of the banana
and the platano as sources of food supply.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8522src" href="#xd21e8522" name="xd21e8522src">4</a> But he did
not have the data we now possess for arriving at just conclusions. As
the result of numerous experiments it is now known that bananas afford
per acre one and a third times as much food as maize produces, two and
a third times as much as oats, three times as much as buckwheat,
potatoes and wheat; and four times as much as rye. Then the labor
involved in the cultivation of the banana is far less than that
demanded for our northern crops. No skill is required, and unlike many
of our northern fruit-bearing trees, the banana and the platano are
entirely exempt from insect pests and diseases.</p>
<p>Chemical analysis discloses the curious fact that bananas and
potatoes are practically identical in composition. As compared with the
principal vegetables and fruits consumed in the United States and
Europe, the food value of the banana and the platano stands in the
ratio of five to four in favor of the latter. Comparing banana flour, a
new product of this remarkable fruit, with the flour made from sago,
wheat and maize, it is found that the nutritive value of all four is
about equal&mdash;the banana product being slightly in the lead.</p>
<p>As a consequence of recent researches the commercial products
obtained from the banana and platano have been greatly increased, while
some of them are vastly different from anything that people who have
been living on them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407"
name="pb407">407</a>]</span>for thousands of years have ever dreamed.
Among these are meal in the starchy state for making superior kinds of
bread and porridge, flakes and meal in a dextrinous condition for the
preparation of nourishing soups and puddings, sauces and
fritters.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8534src" href="#xd21e8534" name=
"xd21e8534src">5</a> In dried slices it is used in the manufacture of
beer and alcohol. Bananas are also employed in making marmalades, for
the manufacture of glucose and syrups for confectionery, and, dried
entire without the peel, they are put up in boxes like figs. Dried and
roasted they afford a nutritious beverage that is said to be a valuable
substitute for coffee and chocolate. Even the stems and leaves of the
banana are put to use, for from them are manufactured paper and
cordage.</p>
<p>These facts open up a splendid vista as to the future food
possibilities of the tropics. They demonstrate also the wisdom of
giving more thought to this neglected part of the world, for it is to
tropical America that the teeming millions of coming generations will
be obliged to look for much of their sustenance. Our northern climes
will be unable to meet the demands that will eventually be made on
them.</p>
<p>Before we boarded the train at Limon for San Jos&eacute;, the
capital of the little republic, a young German, who had visited the
lowlands through which the railway passes, said that we would there see
the most remarkable exhibition of vegetable growth in the world.
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;the
<i>Urwelt</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the primeval forest&mdash;&ldquo;in all its
luxuriance and glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he had never seen any tropical scenery outside of Costa Rica, and
very little of that, we, who had just come from the exuberant forest
regions of the Magdalena and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href=
"#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>the Orinoco, were disposed to give
little heed to his statement. Compared with Germany, the floral display
of Costa Rica was doubtless something really marvelous in the
estimation of our untraveled Teutonic friend, but it could not compare,
we said to ourselves, with the wonders of plant life on which we had
been feasting our eyes during our journey among the Antilles and
through the Northern part of South America.</p>
<p>Our conclusion, however, as we very soon discovered, was quite
unwarranted. The vegetation of the lowlands and of the foothills of the
Costa Rican Cordillera, as we noted on our way to San Jos&eacute;, was
really something wonderful. It was the <i>Urwelt</i> in very truth, and
exhibited a wealth of plant and tree, foliage and bloom such as must
have characterized the foreworld during its richest period. For miles
upon miles along this picturesque railway, we reveled in the glories of
the virgin forest at its best&mdash;a dense, complicated mass of
verdure, a tousled, world-old jungle, surmounted by giants of the
forest, loaded down with festoons of countless creepers and bound
together by innumerable cable-like lianas, each of the richest hues. At
one time we were passing through valleys of enchantment, valleys
pervaded by a languorous haze of lilac and indigo, like the smoke of
incense, valleys rendered musical by scores of hidden streams and
tumultuous torrents bridged over by an entanglement of green fathoms in
depth. At another we were winding around rugged crags and inaccessible
peaks, not bald and barren, as in our temperate climes, but covered to
their very summits with a tapestry of leaf and flower of the most vivid
tropical tints, that at times resembled a cascade of palpitating color,
of emerald foliage and glowing bloom. Here it was the crimson
bouganvilla, there lovely aroides with spathes of delicate purple or
immaculate white, while hard by, fanned into motion by the trickery of
the shifting breeze, were the slender tufts of the bamboo or the
tenuous fronds of the ever-graceful fern tree. On all sides was a
parade <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>of foliage and blossom, a bravery of color to be
found only in the tropics and then only in its most favored
regions.</p>
<p>The astonishing variety and richness of the flora of Costa Rica is
due to the fact that it is the connecting link between the floras of
the two great continents of the North and the South. Besides exhibiting
species peculiar to itself, it presents an infinitude of others found
in North and South America. Those, however, of South America
predominate, the reason being that Costa Rica was connected with the
southern continent long before it was united with that to the
north.</p>
<p>It is a hundred and three miles from Limon to San Jos&eacute; by
rail. The road, a narrow-gauge one, was constructed by an American, Mr.
Minor C. Keith, and compares favorably with our narrow-gauge roads in
the Rocky Mountains. Many difficulties were encountered in laying the
track, some of which, especially those caused by landslides and the
overflowing rivers, seemed at times insuperable. The most serious
impediments, however, were due to the steaming, sweltering, putrid,
fever-laden swamps between the coast and the foothills of the
Cordillera. So great was the mortality among the workmen on account of
pernicious fevers that it is stated that this section of the line cost
a human life for every tie that was laid. Like the valley of the lower
Magdalena, this part of Costa Rica is habitable only by negroes. The
white men who are called there by business make their sojourn as brief
as possible.</p>
<p>It is along this route that are found the best and most extensive
<i>platanales</i>&mdash;banana plantations&mdash;of the country and, as
a consequence, there are many settlements and villages all along the
railroad. And what banana plants are seen here! In height they resemble
trees rather than plants. We saw some that were thirty-five feet high,
bending under golden clusters of fruit weighing at times nearly a
hundred pounds. While sailing along the Orinoco and the Meta we thought
that the <i>platanales</i> we saw on their banks were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>unrivaled for magnitude of plants and wealth of
fruitage, but they were fully equaled if not surpassed by those of
Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Most of the labor connected with the cultivation and shipment of
bananas is performed by negroes from Jamaica and other West Indian
islands. One sees their little frame houses, or shacks, scattered all
along the road in the banana region, and their occupants have the same
jovial, happy-go-lucky disposition that characterizes the negro the
world over. Crowds of them, old and young, are always assembled at the
station on the arrival of every train&mdash;attracted thither by
apparently the same reason that causes their brethren of the North in
the cotton belt to flock to the depot when they hear the whistle of the
locomotive&mdash;childlike curiosity and a desire to get the latest
news at the earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>Quite a number of the female portion had sliced
<i>pi&ntilde;as</i>&mdash;pineapples&mdash;for sale, but they asked as
much for a single slice as a whole pi&ntilde;a would cost in our
markets, while for an entire pineapple they expected four or five times
the price of this fruit in New York, and that in the land of the
pi&ntilde;a. They demanded extravagant prices because, I suppose, they
took it for granted that those who were able to travel in a Pullman
car, as our party did, would not, if the fruit was really wanted,
begrudge paying the amount asked, however exorbitant. But high as the
price was, the fruit was worth it and far more. It was the most
luscious and fragrant fruit we had ever tasted, and incomparably
excelled the best that ever reaches our markets. It was so soft and
juicy that it could be eaten with a spoon, and contained all the fabled
virtues of nectar and ambrosia combined.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may seem, where there were train loads of bananas
at every siding, we were unable to get even a sample of edible fruit
anywhere between Limon and San Jos&eacute;, although we asked for it at
every stopping place. All that was destined for shipment was unripe,
and, while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>there were several other kinds of fruits for
sale, there was not a single ripe banana.</p>
<p>The negroes we saw along the railroad, as well as those observed in
Limon, were a constant study for us, especially when congregated in
large numbers in halls or churches. Like the negroes of Martinique they
are, in the words of Lafcadio Hearn, &ldquo;A population fantastic,
astonishing&mdash;a population of the <i>Arabian
Nights</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8589src" href=
"#xd21e8589" name="xd21e8589src">6</a> They exhibit the whole gamut of
skin tints from the milk-white of the albino to the coal-black of the
Nubian.</p>
<p>Some of the women are remarkable for beauty of form and delicacy of
features. Lissome, statuesque, and of graceful bearing, they are
Juliets in ebony, who exhibit the classic proportions of
&ldquo;ox-eyed&rdquo; Juno or of the Venus of Milo. As simple as
children, they, like their sisters in the Antilles, are as talkative as
parrots and their laugh is as hearty as it is spontaneous.</p>
<p>But it is the dress of the Costa Rican negress that arrests
attention, especially when she is seen in public gatherings of any
kind. Then the design and color of her attire is bizarre in the
extreme. She selects by preference the most flaunting and garish
colors, and, when she appears in her Sunday costume, one would declare
that she had tried to combine the hues of tropical birds, and to mimic
the gorgeousness of the blue-red-yellow macaw.</p>
<p>The description given by Sir F. Treves of the dress of the negress
of Martinique, sums up in a few words the salient features of the
Sunday costume of her sister in Costa Rica. &ldquo;The
headdress,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is very picturesque. It consists of
a &lsquo;madras,&rsquo; an ample handkerchief wound about the head
turban fashion, and finished by a projecting end, which stands up like
the eagle&rsquo;s feather in an Indian&rsquo;s hair. The color of the
madras will be usually a canary yellow striped with black. The hues of
the dress are bewildering. Here are a skirt of roses and a foulard of
sky-blue, a gown of scarlet and yellow with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>a
terra-cotta scarf across the breast, a dress of white striped with
orange below a foulard of green, a frock of primrose spotted with red
and completed by a scarf of mazarine blue. Add to this the necklace of
gold beads, the heavy bracelets, the great earrings, and the
&lsquo;trembling pins&rsquo; that fix the madras, and then realize over
all, the white light of a tropical moon.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8602src" href="#xd21e8602" name="xd21e8602src">7</a></p>
<p>The two places along our route in which we were specially interested
were the village of Matina, in the fertile valley watered by the river
of that name, and Cartago, which was founded by the Spaniards in 1563,
and was, during colonial times, the capital of the country.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the eighteenth century Matina was a port of
some importance and the centre of the largest and best
<i>cacaotales</i>&mdash;cacao haciendas&mdash;in Costa Rica, but owing
to the frequent incursions of pirates and Mosquito Indians, this
fertile territory had to be evacuated. There was also another reason
for abandoning it and that was the hot, enervating, pernicious
atmosphere, and the torrential rains, which were the causes of malaria
and malignant fevers from which the district was never exempt. So bad
was the reputation of the Matina valley in this respect that people, as
the Costa Rican writer, Don Ricardo F. Guardia, informs us in his
<i>Cuentos Ticos</i>, &ldquo;used to confess and make their wills when
they went to Matina, to the famous Matina which inspires fear in men
and madness in mules,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8615src" href=
"#xd21e8615" name="xd21e8615src">8</a> as they used to say in those
days when men were braver and mules better.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Cartago&mdash;how often this Carthaginian name recurs in this part
of the world!&mdash;is a delightful place nearly a mile above sea
level, with a population of about seven thousand souls. It was founded
in 1562 by Juan Vazquez de Coronado, the real conqueror of Costa Rica.
It has a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>very salubrious climate with a mean annual
temperature of 66&deg; F. In 1841 it was almost entirely destroyed by
an earthquake caused by a violent eruption of the volcano of Irazu, at
the foot of which the town is situated. It is noted as the seat of the
Central American Court of Justice, which was inaugurated here as one of
the results of the Peace Congress held in Washington in 1907. In
consequence of the establishment of this tribunal here, the town has
been called the &ldquo;Hague of the New World.&rdquo; Mr. Andrew
Carnegie has contributed $100,000 for the erection of a suitable
edifice in which to hold the sessions of the court. The site selected
for it is the most beautiful in the city, and the structure, on which
work was begun without delay, promises to be the most attractive
feature of Cartago.</p>
<p>Costa Rica is justly celebrated for its coffee. In the London market
it has long been a favorite brand and always commands a high price. It
has a delicious aroma scarcely inferior to that of the best Java or
Mocha berries. We preferred it to any we had found elsewhere in our
tropical wanderings. The haciendas devoted to the cultivation of
coffee&mdash;especially those in the vicinity of Cartago and San
Jos&eacute;&mdash;are kept in splendid condition, and the trees are of
exceptional vigor and productiveness.</p>
<p>Next to bananas, coffee constitutes the most important export of the
republic. It was introduced from Havana about a century ago, and one
may yet see in Cartago the centenarian trees that supplied the seeds
for the plantations of Costa Rica and other parts of Central America.
The value of the coffee and bananas annually exported from the republic
is much greater than that of all the other commodities combined.
Indeed, these two staples are to the commerce of Costa Rica what
tobacco and sugar are to Cuba. Columbus and his followers searched
these countries for gold and spices, but they found but little of
either. If they could return now to these favored lands they would
discover that their real treasures, more precious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>far
than gold mines and groves of spice trees, lay in the indigenous banana
and tobacco plants, and in the two exotic growths, coffee and sugar
cane.</p>
<p>The schedule time of the train from Limon to San Jos&eacute;,
although only one hundred and three miles, is about seven hours. This
is due to the numerous stops made and to the heavy grades up the flanks
of the Cordillera.</p>
<p>Our arrival at the capital was signalized by a genuine tropical
downpour, such as we had not seen elsewhere during our journey. For a
while it seemed to justify the Spanish expression&mdash;<i lang=
"es">llover &aacute; c&aacute;ntaros</i>&mdash;to rain bucketfuls. But
the <i lang="es">aguacero</i>&mdash;the name given these short, heavy
rainfalls&mdash;was of short duration. It was but one of those daily
afternoon showers that characterize the plateau during the winter
season&mdash;<i lang="es">invierno</i>, our summer&mdash;which extends
from the month of May until the end of November. The dry or summer
season&mdash;<i lang="es">verano</i>&mdash;lasts from December until
May and is distinguished by absence of rain. The verano is the season
of the northeast trade winds, which lose their humidity in crossing the
Atlantic Cordillera. The monsoon, which comes from the southwest during
the winter, does not encounter on the Pacific side mountains of
sufficient height to condense the vapor with which it is charged. Thus
it still contains, on its arrival at the central plateau, enough
moisture to produce the heavy precipitation just noted.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8655src" href="#xd21e8655" name=
"xd21e8655src">9</a></p>
<p>But notwithstanding these daily <i lang="es">aguaceros</i>, one can
always count on sunshiny mornings, except during October, which is the
wettest month of the year. It scarcely ever rains before two
o&rsquo;clock P. M., and rarely after five o&rsquo;clock in the
evening.</p>

</div>
<p>We were quite charmed with San Jos&eacute; and its hospitable and
cultured people. In many respects we thought it the most delightful
city we had seen in Latin America&mdash;especially <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name="pb415">415</a>]</span>for
a protracted sojourn. Situated in the smiling valley of the Abra, it is
reputed to be the most beautiful city in Central America, while it is
the second in extent and the third in population, having about thirty
thousand souls. Its altitude is nearly four thousand and seven hundred
feet above the level of the sea, and it has a mean annual temperature
of 70&deg; F. Foreign residents declare that the climate during the dry
season is ideal.</p>
<p>The city counts a number of beautiful churches and public buildings,
but the greatest surprise for us was its superb <i lang="es">Teatro
Nacional</i>. In some of its leading features it is modeled after the
Grand Opera House in Paris, and is really a gem of architecture. It
cost nearly $1,000,000 in gold, and was paid for by an extra tax on
coffee. We have nothing in the United States to compare with it in
beauty and artistic finish, especially in the decoration of its
sumptuous foyer. In the New World it is surpassed only by the <i lang=
"es">Teatro Municipal</i> of Rio de Janeiro and the <i lang="es">Teatro
Colon</i> of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>There are many attractive parks adorned with tastefully arranged
flowers and trees and monuments that would be a credit to any capital.
The monument that appealed most strongly to us was located in the
<i>Parque Nacional</i>, and commemorates the campaign of 1856 against
the Filibusters led by that daring adventurer from the United States,
William Walker. It is also dedicated to the fraternity of the five
Central American republics made one in defense of their independence.
Let us hope that this is a symbol of the birth in the near future of a
new federation of the Central American republics, similar to the one
that was established shortly after they had achieved their independence
under the name of the Republic of Central America. Such a republic
would have fifty per cent more territory than the whole of Great
Britain, and, considering all the natural resources it possesses, it
would, under a stable and progressive government, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>soon
take an honorable place among the nations of the world.</p>
<p>We visited a number of coffee plantations, as well as orchards and
gardens, in the vicinity of San Jos&eacute;, and were surprised at the
variety and luxuriance of every species of vegetable growth.</p>
<p>But it is to the city market that one must go&mdash;especially on
Sundays and <i>dies de fiesta</i>&mdash;holidays&mdash;if one would
have an adequate conception of the floral and pomonic riches of this
favored land.</p>
<p>Here we could easily imagine that we had before us every blossom
that blows. Exposed for sale at a nominal price are the most gorgeous
of flowers still fresh with the morning dew; roses of every size and
color; orchids of the most fantastic forms and of dazzling beauty, to
possess which a New York belle, would, if necessary, pawn a favorite
jewel.</p>
<p>And here one beholds in lavish abundance citrous fruits of every
species, bananas of untold varieties, and scores of other fruits
equally common here but scarcely known except by name in our northern
latitudes. At every turn we see booths filled with guavas, mameys and
mangoes; zapotes, avocados and chirimoyas; papayas, pomegranates and
sapodillas; anonas, bread-fruit, mangosteens, and others too numerous
to mention, that are prized by the natives for the preparation of
<i>dulces</i>&mdash;sweets&mdash;and preserves.</p>
<p>The avocado, also called avocado pear, on account of its shape, is
the fruit of the beautiful tree called by botanists <i>Persea
gratissima</i>, after Perseus, the son of Jupiter and Dan&aelig;. The
English in the Caribbean Islands name this delicious fruit alligator
pear, or midshipman&rsquo;s butter. It, indeed, somewhat resembles
butter in appearance, and, to a certain extent, replaces butter on the
table in the tropics, where real butter is difficult to procure and
more difficult to keep. Of late years it has been introduced into the
North as a salad, and promises, as soon as it becomes generally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>known, to be one of the most popular of tropical
fruits.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, I prefer it to any other, except possibly the
<i>pi&ntilde;a</i>&mdash;pineapple. But one must taste the fresh, ripe
pineapple of the tropics to know its full lusciousness. It is
incomparably more juicy and fragrant than anything our Northern markets
offer. Old Benzoni says of it, &ldquo;It smells well and tastes
better,&rdquo; and declares it to be &ldquo;one of the most relishing
fruits in the world.&rdquo; Sir Walter Raleigh was right when he called
it &ldquo;the prince of fruits.&rdquo; King James thought so highly of
it that he remarked that &ldquo;it was a fruit too delicious for a
subject to taste of.&rdquo; The poet Thomson doubtless entertained a
similar view when he penned the following lines:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Witness, thou best Anana! thou the pride</p>
<p class="line">Of vegetable life, beyond whate&rsquo;er</p>
<p class="line">The poets imagined in the golden age:</p>
<p class="line">Quick let me strip thee of thy tufty coat,</p>
<p class="line">Spread thy ambrosial stores and feast with
Jove.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But delicious as is the pineapple it is, in the
estimation of many, surpassed by the chirimoya. This fruit is likened
by Paez to &ldquo;lumps of flavored cream ready to be frozen, suspended
from the branches of some fairy tree amidst the most overpowering
perfume of its flowers.&rdquo; Clements R. Markham was so enthusiastic
about it that he declared that &ldquo;He who has not tasted the
chirimoya fruit has yet to learn what fruit is.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
pineapple, the mangosteen, and the chirimoya,&rdquo; Dr. Seeman writes,
&ldquo;are considered the finest fruits in the world. I have tasted
them in those localities in which they are supposed to attain their
highest perfection&mdash;the pineapple in Guayaquil, the mangosteen in
the Indian Archipelago, and the chirimoya on the slope of the Andes,
and if I were called upon to act the part of Paris, I would, without
hesitation, assign the apple to the chirimoya. Its taste, indeed,
surpasses that of every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href=
"#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>other fruit, and Haenke was quite
right when he called it the masterpiece of nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fruit that always appealed to us was the papaya, or pawpaw. It
grows in clusters on a tree about twenty feet high. In taste and
appearance it closely resembles a good-sized muskmelon. It is
surprising to see such large fruits growing on so small a tree. It
flowers and fruits at the same time.</p>
<p>The fruits, however, that are the mainstay for the greatest number
of people in the tropics, are, as has already been stated, the banana
and the plantain. The former is known to botanists as <i>Musa
sapientum</i>, <span class="corr" id="xd21e8740" title=
"Source: becauses">because</span> sages have reposed beneath its shade
and eaten its fruit. The latter is called <i>Musa paradisiaca</i>, on
account of a certain tradition that it was the forbidden fruit in
Paradise.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8746src" href="#xd21e8746" name=
"xd21e8746src">10</a> Both the banana and the plantain number almost as
many varieties as the apple. The bananas are smaller than the
plantains. The former range from one to six inches in length, while
some varieties of the latter attain a length of fifteen inches. They
are eaten raw, boiled and roasted and as preserves. A few trees will
supply a whole family with the means of subsistence during the entire
year.</p>
<p>The banana and plantain are just the kinds of plants that specially
appeal to the natives of the equatorial regions, for they give at all
seasons a never-failing abundance of nutritious food, and that, too,
without any more labor and care than are entailed by clearing the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>ground and placing them in the ever-productive
soil.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8759src" href="#xd21e8759" name=
"xd21e8759src">11</a> Sir Charles Dilke, however, regards these food
producers in quite a different light. In his estimation, the banana is
the curse of the tropics. Their very abundance, and the little care
they require, constitute, according to him, a bar to progress and to
civilization of the highest kind in the tropics, for the reason that
all true civilization necessarily presupposes labor and effort. It is
for this reason that the highest faculties of man are most conspicuous
in the <span class="corr" id="xd21e8801" title=
"Source: temporate">temperate</span> zone, where there is a constant
struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Before leaving Barranquilla we met a gentleman who had just
completed a tour of all Latin America and he declared that San
Jos&eacute; was the most beautiful city he had seen in all his
travels.</p>
<p>At the time we gave little credence to what seemed a very
exaggerated impression, but after we were able to judge for ourselves,
we were forced to admit that Costa Rica&rsquo;s fair capital is,
indeed, a most delightful place.</p>
<p>In a charming, secluded vale near the city, where stood the country
seat of a wealthy merchant of the capital, was a particularly romantic
spot. The only places I could recall that could fairly compare with it
were certain upland valleys <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href=
"#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>in the larger islands of the
equatorial Pacific. Hidden away in the luxuriant tropical forest,
alongside a broad mountain torrent, where fruit and flower and foliage
vied with one another in delicacy of fragrance and richness of hue, it
required but little strain of fancy to imagine that we were gazing upon
the wonders of the enchanted isle of Armida and Rinaldo; for here,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Mild was the air, the skies were clear as
glass,</p>
<p class="line">The trees no whirlwind felt nor tempest&rsquo;s
smart,</p>
<p class="line">But ere the fruit drop off, the blossom comes;</p>
<p class="line">This springs that falls, that ripeneth and thus
blooms.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8822src" href="#xd21e8822"
name="xd21e8822src">12</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Whilst gazing in silent rapture at the incomparable
beauty of the scene before us, and carried away by the matchless
exhibitions of Flora and Pomona, we were suddenly transported on the
wings of memory back to the beautiful plaza of Ciudad Bolivar, where,
some months before, we had heard a happy, enthusiastic fianc&eacute;e
declare that she considered the lower Orinoco, aboard a yacht or a
steamer, an ideal place to spend one&rsquo;s honeymoon. With no claim
to the power of mind-reading, or to the spirit of prophecy, we assert,
without fear of erring, that if she had the opportunity of choosing
between the Orinoco valley and this beauty spot near San Jos&eacute;,
as a place to spend her honeymoon&mdash;her <i>luna de miel</i>, as the
Spaniards phrase it&mdash;it would not be to the Orinoco that Don
Esteban would take his bride, but to this Edenic spot on the charming
Costa Rican plateau.</p>
<p>Costa Rica, despite what has often been said to the contrary, has,
for the past half century, been practically free from those fratricidal
revolutions that have so characterized the other Central American
republics. There have, it is true, been occasional
<i>pronunciamientos</i> and periods of excitement about the time of
some of the presidential elections, but none of those devastating
insurrections that have so long been the curse of her less-fortunate
neighbors. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span></p>
<p>Costa Rica points with pride, and well she may, to the fact that she
has more school teachers than soldiers. Everywhere one finds schools
for both sexes, admirably appointed and conducted, and constant efforts
are being made to have them compare favorably with similar institutions
in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The original Spanish inhabitants of the central plateau were of
sturdy Galician stock, and their descendants still exhibit the thrift,
industry and enterprise of their ancestors. One meets many families of
pure Spanish blood, but the majority are evidently mestizos&mdash;the
result of the intermarriage of Spaniards with the aborigines. The
number of pure-blooded Indians is comparatively small&mdash;only about
three thousand out of a total population of a third of a million. There
are few negroes seen outside of the low coast lands, where they
constitute the majority of the inhabitants. We were, indeed, greatly
impressed to note the sudden transition from the black to the white
race as we ascended the Cordillera. In San Jos&eacute; the number of
negroes is astonishingly small, while the complexions of the whites,
compared with that of the majority of the people living in the Andean
lands we had recently visited, is unusually clear and ruddy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fair and delicate are the features of the
Josefinas!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8844src" href="#xd21e8844"
name="xd21e8844src">13</a> exclaimed C., as we took our first promenade
in the broad and well-kept streets of San Jos&eacute;. And with the eye
of a connoisseur, he continued, &ldquo;How tastefully dressed they
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was right. The number of beautiful, Madonna-like types one meets
with is surprising. This impression is probably enhanced in some degree
by the beautifully embroidered <i>pa&ntilde;olones</i>&mdash;large
Chinese silk shawls&mdash;which they know so well how to display to the
best advantage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422"
name="pb422">422</a>]</span>When to the tasteful costume and delicate
features one adds the culture and refinement that often distinguish the
Josefina, one can easily realize that she but continues the best
traditions for beauty and grace of mind and heart that have so long
distinguished her sisters in the land of Isabella of Castile.</p>
<p>After a delightful week spent in San Jos&eacute; we prepared to
return to Limon. We then experienced, probably more than at any other
place in our long journey,&mdash;what all travelers more or less dread
in their peregrinations&mdash;the pang of leaving places that have
especially appealed to one and of saying farewell to newly-formed
friends almost as soon as one has learned to know their goodness of
heart and nobility of character. To me, I confess, this has always been
the greatest drawback of traveling and is something I have never been
able to outgrow.</p>
<p>Armed with a certificate from our consul stating that we had spent
in San Jos&eacute; the time required of passengers coming from
quarantined ports, by the health regulations of Panama, we took our
place in a comfortable parlor car, and were soon on our way towards the
Caribbean coast, but not before we had taken &ldquo;a last, long,
lingering look,&rdquo; at beautiful, hospitable, fascinating San
Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p>As the train slowly moved eastwards towards Cartago, our attention
was directed for the hundredth time to the rich
<i>cafetales</i>&mdash;coffee plantations&mdash;that covered the
fertile acres on both sides of the road. Here and there we noted one of
those cumbersome ox-carts with solid wooden wheels drawn by a yoke of
oxen in charge of an odd-looking <i>boyero</i>. These are rapidly
giving way to more modern means of transportation, but the lover of the
bizarre and the picturesque will regret their disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe,&rdquo; said a Josefino, having some pretensions to
physiognomy, &ldquo;the peculiar features of that <i>boyero</i> on his
way to the market. I will wager anything that that man is a firm
believer in <i>ceguas</i> and <i>cadejos</i> and <i>lloronas</i>; that
he dreams of <i>botijas</i>, even in the daytime, and that he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>has greater fear of <i>hermanos</i> than any of
your countrymen have of ghosts.&rdquo; He then proceeded to explain the
meaning of these terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cegua,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is a monster somewhat
like the sirens of old, that assumes the form of a beautiful woman and
leads men astray. A cadejos is a fantastic animal, black and hairy,
resembling an enormous dog which has resounding hoofs instead of paws.
A llorona is a frightful phantom that is sometimes heard moaning in the
mountains in such wise as to strike terror into the passer-by.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e8913src" href="#xd21e8913" name=
"xd21e8913src">14</a> Botija&mdash;the Spanish for a large earthen
jar&mdash;is the name given in Costa Rica to a buried treasure. The
country people believe that, if one having buried money dies in debt,
his ghost&mdash;hermano&mdash;will haunt the place in great distress
until the treasure is found and the debt is paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could have the assistance of a few such
hermanos,&rdquo; interposed C. laughingly. &ldquo;If I had, I should
have several thousand dollars more to my credit than I have now.
Unfortunately, in my country we have not such aids in bringing our
debtors to book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On our way down the Cordillera, while crossing one of the numerous
iron bridges that span the Reventazon and other mountain rivers and
torrents, our Josefino friend pointed to a pier of masonry standing
alone about forty feet to one side of the bridge. &ldquo;That
pier,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was formerly under the bridge, but in
consequence of a peculiar landslide or earthquake, it was transported,
together with a part of the bed of the stream, to the spot where it now
stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he told us of the opposition of the boyeros to the
construction of the railroad. They, like ill-advised people in other
parts of the world, feared that it would ruin their occupation and
reduce them and their families to starvation. The government and
railway company <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424"
name="pb424">424</a>]</span>cleverly overcame this opposition by
employing the boyeros to haul the material used in the construction of
the road.</p>
<p>Then, too, there were wiseacres in Costa Rica, as there were in our
Rocky Mountain region when there was question of undertaking some of
the remarkable engineering feats that characterize several of our
transcontinental railroads, who declared that the projectors of the
road from Limon to San Jos&eacute; were essaying the impossible.
&ldquo;General Guardia&rdquo;&mdash;the dictator under whose rule the
road was begun&mdash;they declared &ldquo;is trying to build a railroad
to Port Limon, where the birds themselves can scarcely go with
wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, aside from the landslides which occur in all mountainous
countries, and the miasmatic climate, there were but few great
difficulties encountered. From an engineering standpoint the
construction of the road offered far less difficult problems than many
of the railroads in Colorado, Peru and Ecuador. The curves are not so
sharp and the grades are less, while the altitude attained is less than
half of that reached by several Rocky Mountain roads and less than
one-third of the height of the celebrated Andean railway which connects
Oroya with Lima.</p>
<p>Our first care on arriving at Limon was to have the health officer
of that place countersign the certificate we had received from our
consul in San Jos&eacute;. We then boarded our steamer and were ready
to start for Panama.</p>
<p>The weather was again in our favor, and we had a most delightful
sail to Colon, and needless to say, we enjoyed every moment of it. We
enjoyed it particularly on account of its interesting historical
associations, and the romantic legends that have been woven about every
isle and inlet and headland along the coast.</p>
<p>That, however, which appealed most strongly to us was the land of
Veragua, near the dividing line between Costa Rica and Panama. It was
here that Columbus imagined he had found the Golden Chersonese, the
land whence came the gold used in the construction of Solomon&rsquo;s
temple. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>In the letter to his sovereigns, dispatched from
Jamaica, he contends &ldquo;that these mines of the Aurea are identical
with those of Veragua.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e8936src" href=
"#xd21e8936" name="xd21e8936src">15</a></p>
<p>It was here, too, near the mouth of the river Belen, that the first
settlement on the continent of the New World was located. Although it
had soon to be abandoned, it was begun with a view of permanent
occupancy, and as such is deserving of special notice. A suitable
memorial should indicate this spot, as one should also mark the site of
Isabella, the first settlement in the New World.</p>
<p>It was while on the coast of Veragua that Columbus heard of the
great ocean now known as the Pacific.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e8944src" href="#xd21e8944" name="xd21e8944src">16</a> He was not,
however, permitted to add its discovery to the long list of his
marvelous achievements. That honor was reserved for Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez
de Balboa.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock the morning following our departure from
Limon we dropped anchor in the harbor of Colon. The sea was so tranquil
that there was scarcely a ripple on its placid waters. It was certainly
in marked contrast with the condition in which Columbus once found it
in these parts; for he assures us, in the oft-quoted letter to
Ferdinand and Isabella, that &ldquo;never was sea so high, so terrific,
and so covered with foam.&rdquo; It seemed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>like
a &ldquo;sea of blood, seething like a cauldron on a mighty
fire.&rdquo; So continual, indeed, were the shifting winds, and so
terrific were the storms, that the coast from Veragua to Colon which we
had found washed by so calm a sea was by Columbus and his companions
named <i lang="es">La Costa de los Contrastes</i>.</p>
<p>Immediately on our arrival our vessel was boarded by the health
officers of the port. Those who could not produce a satisfactory health
certificate&mdash;and many could not&mdash;were sent to quarantine.
Many of our party, however, did not require any, as they did not
purpose landing at Colon. Some of them were bound for Jamaica and for
points more distant. Among them was C., my brave and resolute companion
across the Andes, the loyal and generous young cavalier who, if he had
not been of superior mold, would more than once have lost his heart
during the course of our long journey. I would fain have enjoyed his
companionship longer while following the conquistadores in lands
farther south; but it was not to be. To him, and to other friends, I
had regretfully to pronounce the words of parting that had so
frequently been addressed to us by the kindly and hospitable people we
had met all along our route&mdash;<i lang="es">Que Uds. vayan bien, y
con la Virgen!</i>&mdash;A happy journey and with the Virgin
Mother!</p>
<p>As I left our good ship and the friends it bore to divers
destinations and stepped ashore alone, a stranger in a strange land, I
felt, I must confess, not unlike Dante when he suddenly found himself
deprived of the companionship of Virgil, who had been his friend and
guide during his arduous journey down through the fearsome pits of Hell
and up the precipitous ledges of the mountain of Purgatory. But this
impression, strong though it was, could not long remain dominant. What
had in the beginning of my journey been but &ldquo;a consummation
devoutly to be wished,&rdquo; had during our wanderings in tropical
lands crystallized into a determination to make the desire a reality.
The happy termination of our voyage up the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>Orinoco and down the Magdalena was conclusive
evidence that travel, even through the least frequented parts of South
America, was far from being as difficult as it has long been depicted.
The moment, then, that I stepped from the gang plank that connected our
steamer with Panaman soil, the Rubicon was crossed, and I had resolved,
<i lang="fr">co&ucirc;te que co&ucirc;te</i>,&mdash;alone, if
necessary,&mdash;to realize the long-cherished dream of my
youth,&mdash;to visit the famed lands of the Incas and explore the
fertile valleys under the equator. If my experience in the llanos and
among the Cordilleras had not made me &ldquo;fit to mount up to the
stars,&rdquo; as Dante was when he left the Terrestrial Paradise, it
had at least renewed me &ldquo;even as new trees with new
foliage,&rdquo; and I was ready to undertake a longer and more
difficult journey than the one just completed and eager to follow the
conquistadores along the Andes and down the Amazon. <span class=

origin of the name Costa Rica is uncertain. It appears for the first
time in an account of an expedition made by Martin Estete to the river
San Juan in 1529, twenty-seven years after the discovery of the country
by Columbus. It occurs subsequently in a document signed by the King of
Spain, dated May 14, 1541. It is probable that the name was given in
consequence of the rich mines that had been discovered near the town of
Estrella, in Talamanca&mdash;from which it was inferred that all the
interior of the country was equally rich in the precious
metals&mdash;and not on account of the luxuriant vegetation that
abounds, as is sometimes supposed. Cf. <i lang="es">Diccionario

These proportions, however, refer to the weights and not to the
nutritive values of the products compared. The ratio of the nutritive
value of bananas and wheat is, according to Humboldt, twenty-five to
one in favor of bananas. Hence, he writes, &ldquo;a European, newly

<p class="first">AN AMERICAN ADMIRAL.</p>
<p>Forty-five Years Under the Flag.</p>
<p>By <span class="sc">Winfield Scott Schley</span>, Rear-Admiral, U.
S. N. Illustrated. 8vo. Cloth, uncut edges, and gilt top, $3.00
net.</p>
<p>About one-third of Admiral Schley&rsquo;s volume is devoted to the
Spanish War, in which he became so great a figure. He tells his own
story in simple and effective words. His recollections are constantly
reinforced by references to dispatches and other documents.</p>
<p>Readers will be surprised at the extent of Admiral Schley&rsquo;s
experiences. He left the Naval Academy just before the outbreak of the
Civil War and saw service with Farragut in the Gulf. Three chapters are
devoted to Civil War events. His next important service was rendered
during the opening of Corea to the commerce of the world, and the
chapter in which he describes the storming of the forts is one of
thrilling interest. Another important expedition in his life was the
rescue of Greely, to which three chapters are devoted. Two other
chapters pertain to the Revolution in Chili, and the troubles growing
out of the attack upon some of Admiral Schley&rsquo;s men in the
streets of Valparaiso.</p>
<p>Altogether the book contains thirty-eight chapters. It has been
illustrated from material furnished by Admiral Schley and through his
suggestions, and makes an octavo volume of large size. It will appeal
to every true-hearted American.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The author says in his preface: &ldquo;In times of
danger and duty the writer endeavored to do the work set before him
without fear of consequences. With this thought in mind, he has felt
moved, as a duty to his wife, his children, and his name, to leave a
record of his long professional life, which has not been without some
prestige, at least for the flag he has loved and under which he has
served the best years of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rear-Admiral W. S. Schley&rsquo;s &lsquo;Forty-five Years
Under the Flag&rsquo; is the most valuable contribution to the history
of the American Navy that has been written in many a
year.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The author&rsquo;s career is well worthy of a book, and he
has every reason for pride in telling of his forty-five active years in
all parts of the world.&rdquo; &mdash;<i>Edwin L. Shuman in the Chicago
Record-Herald.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a stirring story, told with the simple directness of a
sailor. Its reading carries the conviction of its truthfulness. The
Admiral could not have hoped to accomplish
more.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;He has told his own story in his own way, from his own
viewpoint, and goes after his detractors, open and above board, with
his big guns.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Washington Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a work that will interest every one, from the
sixteen-year-old school-boy who is studying history and loves tales of
stirring adventure to the grandsire whose blood still pulses hotly with
patriotic pride at the recounting of valiant deeds of arms under our
starry flag.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston American.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Admiral tells the story well. His is a manly and
straightforward style. He leaves nothing to doubt, nothing open to
controversy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Baltimore Sun.</i></p>

<p>BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY.</p>
<p>The Journal of Latrobe.</p>
<p>Being the Notes and Sketches of an Architect, Naturalist, and
Traveller in the United States from 1796 to 1820 By <span class=
"sc">Benjamin Henry Latrobe</span>, Architect of the Capitol at
Washington. Copiously illustrated with reproductions from the original
drawings by the author. 8vo. Ornamental cloth, $3.50 net.</p>
<p>These are the memoirs of a personal friend of the first President of
the United States. He was a man of refinement and great intellectual
attainments, a soldier, civil engineer, philosopher, artist, humorist,
poet, and naturalist. The book is bright with story and anecdote,
criticism and comment.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Benjamin Latrobe was a man of the world and a
clever commentator on what he saw going on around him. One of the best
pen pictures of Washington is Latrobe&rsquo;s account of a visit to the
Father of his Country at Mt. Vernon in 1796.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Review of
Reviews.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Latrobe was a keen observer, and his notes of travel in
the South are valuable in an attempt to picture the life of a century
ago.&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Benjamin Latrobe visited Washington at Mt. Vernon and
recorded what he saw very fully. Then, late in life, he went to New
Orleans by sea and wrote full notes of his voyage and his impressions.
Both diaries are full of interest. Between them are placed in this
volume papers relating to the building of the Capitol. Prefixed to the
volume is a biographical introduction written by his son thirty years
ago. The illustrations are curious and interesting.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New
York Sun.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;With what has been said of the volume it should be evident
that it is curious, interesting, and instructive to an unusual degree.
To speak of &lsquo;The Journal of Latrobe&rsquo; without mention of its
illustrations would be an unpardonable oversight.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>San
Francisco Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>VIVID, MOVING, SYMPATHETIC, HUMOROUS.</p>
<p>A Diary from Dixie.</p>
<p>By <span class="sc">Mary Boykin Chesnut</span>. Being her Diary from
November, 1861, to August, 1865. Edited by Isabella D. Martin and Myrta
Lockett Avary. Illustrated 8vo. Ornamental Cloth, $2.50 net; postage
additional.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chesnut was the most brilliant woman that the South has ever
produced, and the charm of her writing is such as to make all
Southerners proud and all Northerners envious. She was the wife of
James Chesnut, Jr., who was United States Senator from South Carolina
from 1859 to 1861, and acted as an aid to President Jefferson Davis,
and was subsequently a Brigadier-General in the Confederate Army. Thus
it was that she was intimately acquainted with all the foremost men in
the Southern cause.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;In this diary is preserved the most moving and
vivid record of the Southern Confederacy of which we have any
knowledge. It is a piece of social history of inestimable value. It
interprets to posterity the spirit in which the Southerners entered
upon and struggled through the war that ruined them. It paints
poignantly but with simplicity the wreck of that old world which had so
much about it that was beautiful and noble as well as evil. Students of
American life have often smiled, and with reason, at the stilted and
extravagant fashion in which the Southern woman had been described
south of Mason and Dixon&rsquo;s line&mdash;the unconscious
self-revelations of Mary Chesnut explain, if they do not justify, such
extravagance. For here, we cannot but believe, is a creature of a fine
type, a &lsquo;very woman,&rsquo; a very Beatrice, frank, impetuous,
loving, full of sympathy, full of humor. Like her prototype, she had
prejudices, and she knew little of the Northern people she criticised
so severely; but there is less bitterness in these pages than we might
have expected. Perhaps the editors have seen to that. However this may
be they have done nothing to injure the writer&rsquo;s own nervous,
unconventional style&mdash;a style breathing character and temperament
as the flower breathes fragrance.&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is written straight from the heart, and with a natural
grace of style that no amount of polishing could have
imparted.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;The editors are to be congratulated; it is not every day that
one comes on such material as this long-hidden
diary.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Louisville Evening Post.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a book that would have delighted Charles
Lamb.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Houston Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>ALL ABOUT EARTHQUAKES.</p>
<p>Earthquakes.</p>
<p>By Prof. <span class="sc">William Herbert Hobbs</span>, Ph.D.,
formerly of the University of Wisconsin and now head of the Department
of Geology in the University of Michigan. Illustrated. 12mo. Ornamental
cloth, $1.50 net; postage additional.</p>
<p>Any book on earthquakes prepared by a great authority and adapted
for popular reading would be interesting. Professor Hobbs has been for
years a special student of the noted geological tract in southwestern
New England, which is the focus of much controversy and in which he
prepared himself for the especial study of earthquakes, faults, dikes,
and associated phenomena. From his experience in America, in Spain, and
in Italy, he has been fortunately enabled to discover what promises to
be a new law of earthquake faults, which law is so simple and
appropriate that it was at once adopted by the world&rsquo;s greatest
authority on earthquakes, the Count de Montessus de Ballore.</p>
<p>While the book contains allusions to the new theory of earthquake
faults, it also fairly presents the whole subject of earthquakes in its
proper proportion and perspective, giving complete lists of all the
great seismological disturbances and detailed descriptions of all the
more important and typical earthquakes. The book is written from the
standpoint of a great scientist, but in language which an ordinary
reader can easily understand.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Mr. Hobbs&rsquo; study of the subject is
exhaustive and very clear, sensible and of practical
benefit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Hobbs furnishes valuable observations made of
recent earthquakes. The book is scholarly and well written; a good book
that even the casual reader can peruse with
pleasure.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York World.</i></p>

facts, presented in a way which may prove of practical
use.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;A very valuable book. The results of Professor Groos&rsquo;s
original and acute investigations will be especially appreciated by
those who are interested in psychology and sociology, and they are of
